contains code related to optimizer configurations and modifications in the project. It includes files for importing various optimizer configurations, implementing different types of optimizers, and defining optimizer modifier classes. The code optimizes the performance of the optimizers for mixed-precision training by overriding functions and providing faster implementations. Additionally, the directory includes files for learning rate schedulers and a class for applying operations to tensors in chunks. Overall, the "optim" directory plays a crucial role in managing and enhancing the optimization process for training neural networks in the project.
