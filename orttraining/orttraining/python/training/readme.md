contains files and subdirectories that are crucial for training and optimizing machine learning models within the project. It includes files for managing checkpoint states, implementing learning rate schedulers, defining training and evaluation of ONNX models, and updating model parameters using an optimizer. The directory also includes code for building and manipulating ONNX models, as well as initializing and configuring the ONNX Runtime (ORT) module for PyTorch. Additionally, it contains code for managing optimizer configurations and modifications, as well as utility functions for working with PyTorch models and tensors. The "training" directory plays a central role in enabling the training and optimization of machine learning models using the project's framework.
