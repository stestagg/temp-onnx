contains Python code related to data handling and sampling in the project. It includes an initialization file that imports classes from the sampler module. The sampler module provides implementations of load balancing distributed samplers and batch samplers for datasets. These samplers balance the data load across workers based on sample complexity and generate mini-batches with similar computational complexity. They are particularly useful in scenarios where the dataset has variable-length samples and distributed training suffers from the straggler problem.
