provides utility functions and a custom sampler class for data sampling and load balancing in distributed training scenarios. It includes functions for sharding dataset indices across workers and a custom sampler class that balances the data load based on sample complexity. The code interacts with other parts of the project by utilizing functions and classes from the `torch` and `torch.utils.data` modules. Other parts of the project can import and use the provided classes for distributed training.
