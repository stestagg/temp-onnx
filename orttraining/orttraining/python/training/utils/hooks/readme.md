contains files that define and implement subscribers and subscriber managers for processing activation tensors during the forward pass of a neural network model. These subscribers collect statistics about tensor activations, such as shape, data type, min/max/mean/std values, and number of zero/negative/positive elements. The statistics are written to separate files for each run step. There is also a script that merges convergence debugging per activation summary files into per-step summary files, allowing for comparison between different runs. The directory plays a crucial role in managing and analyzing activation statistics in the project.
