contains the Python code for the training module of a machine learning framework. It includes files for managing checkpoint states, implementing a linear learning rate scheduler, defining the training and evaluation of ONNX models, and updating model parameters using an optimizer. These files provide essential functionality for training and optimizing machine learning models within the framework.
