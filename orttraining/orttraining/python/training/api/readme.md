covers the functionality related to the public API of the ONNX Runtime Training module. It includes classes such as `Module`, `CheckpointState`, `LinearLRScheduler`, and `Optimizer`, which are used for training and evaluating ONNX models. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using classes from modules such as `checkpoint_state`, `onnxruntime.capi.onnxruntime_inference_collection`, and `C`. It also imports and exposes classes from the `optimizer` module for updating model parameters based on gradients and from the `lr_scheduler` module for scheduling learning rates.
