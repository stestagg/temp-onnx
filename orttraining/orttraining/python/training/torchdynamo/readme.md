contains code related to custom operations and the backend for compiling and executing sub-graphs in the DORT project. It defines custom operations and provides a function to register them. The OrtBackend class in "ort_backend.py" is responsible for partitioning the graph into supported and unsupported sub-graphs, replacing functions, and executing the sub-graphs using the ONNXRuntime framework. The "register_backend.py" file defines the default backend for the ORT compiler in Dynamo and provides a wrapper function for compiling models using ORT for training and inference.
