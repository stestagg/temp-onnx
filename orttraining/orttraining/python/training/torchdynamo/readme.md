covers the backend implementation for the ONNX Runtime Training module. It includes functions and classes for handling operations, devices, and data types in the training process. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing modules and functions from the ONNX Runtime, PyTorch, and TorchFX libraries. It also uses custom symbols and schemas to determine the supported ONNX operations. The code plays a crucial role in enabling training functionality by providing the necessary backend implementation for handling tensors, devices, and operations. Additionally, it defines custom symbols for custom operations supported in DORT and sets the default backend for the ONNX Runtime Training project.
