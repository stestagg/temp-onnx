the functionality of optimization in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes classes for adding an AdamW optimizer node and building a gradient clipping subgraph to an ONNX model. These classes interact with other parts of the project by manipulating the ONNX model graph and performing specific optimization operations. The code in this directory interacts with other functional areas of the system by providing optimization capabilities during training.
