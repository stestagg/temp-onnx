covers the functionality of building and manipulating ONNX models for training in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes classes for saving and loading checkpoints, defining forward and gradient models, manipulating ONNX models using building blocks, and providing utility functions for working with ONNX graphs. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using the ONNX Runtime library, accessing and modifying the global model, and performing specific operations such as adding loss functions and optimization nodes to the model.
