contains Python code for building and manipulating ONNX models for training and evaluation in a machine learning framework. It includes files for training APIs, utility functions for working with ONNX models, building blocks for modifying the model graph, functions for saving and loading checkpoints, a model accessor class for manipulating ONNX models, and base classes for building forward and training blocks. Additionally, it contains subdirectories for implementing various loss functions and an optimizer for training ONNX blocks.
