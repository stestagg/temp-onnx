Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality of defining and exporting four loss functions: BCEWithLogitsLoss, CrossEntropyLoss, L1Loss, and MSELoss. These loss functions are used in the training process of the ONNX Runtime Training project. The code in the "loss.py" file defines two classes, MSELoss and CrossEntropyLoss, which are ONNX blocks for adding loss functions to an ONNX model during training. These classes inherit from the Block class and interact with other parts of the project through imports of modules and functions from the onnxruntime.training.onnxblock package. They also utilize helper functions from the _graph_utils module to manipulate the ONNX graph.
