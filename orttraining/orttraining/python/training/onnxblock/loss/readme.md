contains files that define and implement various loss functions used in the training process of the project. These loss functions, such as BCEWithLogitsLoss, CrossEntropyLoss, L1Loss, and MSELoss, can be added to the project's onnx model to calculate the loss between the model's output and the target values. The loss functions offer different reduction methods, such as mean or sum, and provide flexibility for custom weightings and ignoring specific target values.
