covers the functionality of the HierarchicalORTModule class in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It provides a way to wrap submodules of a PyTorch module as ORTModules, allowing for the delegation of supported computations to ONNX Runtime. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing and using classes and functions from the ortmodule, ORtModule, and debug_options modules.
