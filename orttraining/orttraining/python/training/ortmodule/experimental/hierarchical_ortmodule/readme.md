contains the code for implementing the HierarchicalORTModule class, which is responsible for wrapping submodules of a PyTorch module as ORTModule whenever possible. It handles supported computations using ONNX Runtime and unsupported computations using PyTorch. Additionally, it handles the case where a module instance is called multiple times in a single forward() call with different inputs. The directory also includes the implementation of the _IteratedORTModule class, which is used to handle this case by creating multiple ORTModule instances for a given nn.Module instance and using one of them for each input set.
