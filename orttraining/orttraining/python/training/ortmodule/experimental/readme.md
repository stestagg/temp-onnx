contains code related to the experimental features and functionalities of the project. It includes the initialization file for setting up configurations and imports. Additionally, it contains subdirectories for handling the loading and application of configuration settings for an ORTModule instance using JSON files, as well as implementing the HierarchicalORTModule class for wrapping submodules of a PyTorch module as ORTModule. The directory also includes the implementation of the _IteratedORTModule class for handling multiple calls to a module instance with different inputs.
