contains files that handle the loading and application of configuration settings for an ORTModule instance in the project. These settings are stored in a JSON file that follows a specific schema and can include features such as PropagateCastOps, UseExternalGPUAllocator, EnableCustomAutogradFunction, and more. The files in this directory parse the JSON file, validate the data, and update the corresponding settings in the ORTModule instance.
