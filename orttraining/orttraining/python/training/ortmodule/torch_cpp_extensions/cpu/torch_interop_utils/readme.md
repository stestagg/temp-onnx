Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality of managing shared pointers to PyNode objects in the Torch autograd system. It includes a class called PyNodeSharedPointerPool that registers and unregisters gradient functions associated with a context address, and a function called clear_grad_fns_for_next_edges that performs operations on tensors based on their leaf status. The code interacts with other parts of the system by being included in the Torch C++ extension module for the ONNX Runtime Training project and using classes and functions from the Torch autograd system.

Interactions:
- The code interacts with the Torch C++ extension module for the ONNX Runtime Training project.
- It uses classes and functions from the Torch autograd system to manage gradient functions and perform operations on tensors.
- The code in the __init__.py file interacts with the torch_interop_utils module from the ortmodule.torch_cpp_extensions package to clear all gradient functions.
- The setup.py file interacts with the torch.utils.cpp_extension module to define and build the torch_interop_utils extension module during installation.
