contains code related to managing shared pointers to gradient functions in a PyTorch project. It includes functions to register and unregister gradient functions, as well as clear all registered gradient functions. Additionally, it provides a function to clear the gradient functions for the next edges in the computation graph. The code also defines a Pybind11 module to expose these functions to Python.
