contains CUDA extension modules and code for GPU memory management and multi-tensor operations in the project. It includes the "torch_gpu_allocator" module for allocating and deallocating GPU memory using a caching allocator. Additionally, it includes the "fused_ops" module for implementing efficient fused operations such as Adam optimization, scaling, and computing L2 norm. These modules enable parallel processing on the GPU, support different data types and memory access patterns, and are crucial components of the project's GPU memory management and multi-tensor operation functionality.
