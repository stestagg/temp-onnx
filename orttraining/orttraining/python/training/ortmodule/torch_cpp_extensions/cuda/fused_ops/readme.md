contains CUDA code and Python bindings for implementing multi-tensor operations in the project. It includes functions for Adam optimization, scaling, and computing L2 norm. The code supports parallel processing on the GPU and handles different data types and memory access patterns. The directory also includes a setup script for compiling and building a CUDA extension module called "fused_ops", which enables efficient fused operations in the project.
