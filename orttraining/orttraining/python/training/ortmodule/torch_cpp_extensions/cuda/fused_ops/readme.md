covers the functionality of performing various fused operations on multiple tensors in parallel using CUDA. This includes operations such as calculating the L2 norm, scaling tensors, performing the axpby operation, and implementing the Adam optimizer. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, using functions and classes from the ATen and CUDA libraries, and exchanging data with other parts of the project. It is likely used in conjunction with other components of the ONNX Runtime Training project to perform complex training operations on GPUs.
