manages the support for PyTorch C++ extensions within the ORTModule project. It automatically detects and installs the extensions, which are organized in folders and must contain a setup.py file. The directory also includes code for building PyTorch CPP extensions, both for CUDA/ROCM and non-CUDA/ROCM extensions. It provides functionality for managing shared pointers to gradient functions, registering and unregistering gradient functions, and clearing registered gradient functions. Additionally, it includes CUDA extension modules for GPU memory management and multi-tensor operations, such as allocating and deallocating GPU memory and implementing efficient fused operations. These modules enable parallel processing on the GPU and support different data types and memory access patterns. Overall, the directory plays a crucial role in supporting PyTorch C++ extensions and providing essential functionality for GPU memory management and multi-tensor operations in the ORTModule project.
