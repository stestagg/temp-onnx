The code in this directory provides support for PyTorch C++ extensions within the ORTModule of the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes functionality for automatically detecting and installing PyTorch C++ extensions. The code interacts with other parts of the project by building and installing the necessary CPP extensions for both CPU and GPU support, handling configuration and setup of CUDA/ROCM versions, and installing the PyTorch CPP extensions into the local ONNX Runtime package folder.
