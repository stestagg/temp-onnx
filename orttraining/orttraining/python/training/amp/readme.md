contains Python code related to loss scaling in a mixed precision training setup. It includes the `__init__.py` file, which imports classes from the `loss_scaler` module. The `loss_scaler.py` file defines two classes, `LossScaler` and `DynamicLossScaler`, which are used for implementing custom loss scaling strategies. The `DynamicLossScaler` class provides a default implementation for loss scaling, doubling the loss scale every certain number of stable training steps and halving it when gradients explode. It also allows for automatic or manual loss scaling updates.
