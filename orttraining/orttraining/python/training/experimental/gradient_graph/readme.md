contains a Python module that provides functionality for building a gradient graph for a PyTorch model. This gradient graph allows for the computation of gradients during an inference session. The module includes a function that takes in the model, a loss function, example input and labels, and the path to save the gradient graph. It registers any loss nodes that expect multiple outputs and creates a wrapper module for the model. The function then exports the model to ONNX format, builds the gradient graph using the exported model, and saves it to the specified path.
