covers the functionality of exporting a gradient graph using the "export_gradient_graph" function. It also includes functionality to export a JIT graph to an ONNX model proto. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing functions and modules from the torch and torch.onnx packages, as well as the ONNX Runtime Training library. It also imports the "export_gradient_graph" function from the "_gradient_graph_tools" module.
