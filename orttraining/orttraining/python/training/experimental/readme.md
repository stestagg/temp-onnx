contains Python code related to building and exporting a gradient graph for a PyTorch model. It includes an initialization file that imports a function from another module, and a file that exports a JIT graph to an ONNX model proto. The "gradient_graph" subdirectory provides functionality for building the gradient graph, including registering loss nodes and creating a wrapper module for the model. The exported model is then used to build the gradient graph, which is saved to a specified path.
