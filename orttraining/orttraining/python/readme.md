contains files and subdirectories that are crucial for training and optimizing machine learning models within the project. It includes functionality for aggregating and combining checkpoint files, training and evaluating models using ONNX Runtime (ORT), and managing training sessions. The directory also includes code for configuring and running training sessions, building gradient graphs, and managing training agents and optimizers. Additionally, it contains code for extending the functionality of the torch.onnx module and implementing custom implementations for specific operations. The "python" directory plays a central role in enabling the training and optimization of machine learning models using the project's framework.
