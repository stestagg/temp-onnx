contains code related to the implementation of lazy tensors in the project. It includes files for compiling and executing subgraphs using ONNX Runtime (ORT) and PyTorch, converting between PyTorch and ONNX Runtime scalar types and tensors, handling CUDA execution provider functionality, converting values to strings and comparing tensors and scalars, reading environment variables for system settings, implementing a fusion optimization pass for computational graphs, and registering custom callable functions in PyTorch's JIT executor. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling lazy tensor functionality and optimizing performance in the project.
