contains code for building and running training sessions for a machine learning model. It includes functions for building the gradient graph, transforming the graph with GIST compression, and running the training session with synthetic input data. The code also includes tests to verify the correctness of the graph transformations and training session. Additionally, it contains code for building optimizer graphs in the training session, with implementations for different types of optimizer graph builders. The optimizer graph includes operations for gradient accumulation, mixed precision, allreduce, and ZeRO optimization. The code also verifies the presence of specific operations in the optimizer graph based on the configuration.
