contains code for testing the functionality of the external transformer component in the project. It includes a class called "OutputGrabber" that captures standard output or another stream. Additionally, it contains code for a neural network model and a unit test. The code demonstrates how to use the "OutputGrabber" class to capture the output of a training step in the neural network model and assert the presence of a specific message in the captured output.
