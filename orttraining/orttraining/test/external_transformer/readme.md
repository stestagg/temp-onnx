contains code for testing the functionality of the external transformer component in the project. It includes a class called "OutputGrabber" that captures standard output or another stream. The directory also contains code for a neural network model and a unit test. Additionally, the directory "test_external_transformers" defines a custom rewrite rule for optimizing a graph in the training module of a larger system. This rule is registered as an external transformer and applied to the graph under certain conditions.
