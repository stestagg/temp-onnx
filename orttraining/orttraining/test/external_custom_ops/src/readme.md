contains the source code for custom operators used in the project. Specifically, the file "foo_op.cpp" defines a custom operator called "Foo" in the ONNX namespace. This operator takes an input tensor and copies it to the output tensor. It supports signed numeric tensor types and includes a shape inference function. Additionally, the file registers the custom operator and exports it for use in other modules.
