contains the necessary files and source code for building and using external custom operators in the project. It includes a CMakeLists.txt file for configuring the build, a setup.py script for building and installing the custom ops, and a test.py file for running inference on an ONNX model using the custom ops. The "src" subdirectory contains the source code for the custom operators, including a file that defines a custom operator called "Foo" in the ONNX namespace. The "testdata" subdirectory contains a script for generating and saving an ONNX model with the "Foo" custom operator. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling the project to use and work with custom operators for various machine learning tasks.
