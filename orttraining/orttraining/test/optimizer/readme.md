contains files that are responsible for various optimization functionalities in the project. It includes unit tests for classes such as ComputeOptimizer, MemoryOptimizer, and ShapeOptimizer, which test the functionality and correctness of optimization algorithms. The tests cover different optimization techniques, such as inserting Gather nodes before SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss, optimizing memory usage through re-computation, and optimizing the shape of tensors in a graph. These files ensure that the optimization functionalities are correctly implemented and produce the desired results.
