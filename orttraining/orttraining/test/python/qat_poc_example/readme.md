contains code related to quantization-aware training (QAT) on the MNIST dataset. It includes files for defining a PyTorch model, exporting the model to ONNX format, and performing static quantization on the model. There are also files for training the QAT model using the onnxruntime training APIs and creating training artifacts. The directory provides functionality for preprocessing data, creating dataloaders, and logging training and evaluation metrics. Overall, it focuses on implementing and training a QAT model for the MNIST dataset.
