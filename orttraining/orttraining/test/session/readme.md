contains files related to the training session functionality of a machine learning project. It includes unit tests for loading and verifying the optimizer state for different optimization algorithms and precision configurations. The tests cover both full precision and mixed precision scenarios, with support for both FP32 and FP16 moments. Additionally, the directory includes utility functions for generating optimizer configurations, initializing optimizer states, separating state tensors, verifying states and optimizer states, getting model output names, and building and running training sessions with checks. Overall, the directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the correct functioning of the training session component of the machine learning project.
