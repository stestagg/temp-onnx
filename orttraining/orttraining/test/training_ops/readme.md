contains code and test cases for various operations and functions implemented in the project. It includes functionality for testing the operations on both CPU and CUDA, comparing results with expected output, and creating test cases for different input and output dimensions. The "cuda" subdirectory contains test cases and code for various operations and optimizers implemented in the CUDA kernel, covering different input dimensions, data types, and scenarios. The "cpu" subdirectory contains unit tests for operations related to training neural networks, mathematical computations, activation functions, tensor manipulation, and reduction operations, ensuring correctness and functionality. Overall, the "training_ops" directory plays a crucial role in testing and validating the functionality of the project's operations and optimizers.
