contains test cases for various gradient operations used in the activation functions of a deep learning framework. These tests ensure the accuracy of gradient calculations and match the expected results. The operations tested include GeluGrad, FastGeluGrad, BiasGeluGradDx, BiasFastGeluGradDx, ReluGrad, SigmoidGrad, TanhGrad, and QuickGeluGrad. The tests cover different scenarios such as basic input values, broadcasted bias values, and different alpha values for QuickGeluGrad.
