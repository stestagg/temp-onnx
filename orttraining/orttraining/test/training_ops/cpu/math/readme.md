in the project contains test files for the CPU operations related to mathematical computations. It includes files such as "element_wise_op_grad_test.cc" and "isfinite_ops_test.cc". These files contain unit tests for various mathematical operations, such as IsFinite and IsAllFinite, covering different data types and scenarios. The tests ensure that the operations are functioning correctly and producing the expected results.
