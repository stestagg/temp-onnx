contains test cases and unit tests for various operations related to training neural networks. It includes tests for the forward training of the BatchNormInternal operation, broadcasting scenarios for the BroadcastGradientArgs operation, and different scenarios for the Dropout and DropoutGrad operations. These tests cover input data setup, attribute configuration, operation execution, and output verification. The tests also check the values of running_mean, running_var, saved_mean, and saved_inv_std. The DefaultCpuExecutionProvider is used for executing the tests.
