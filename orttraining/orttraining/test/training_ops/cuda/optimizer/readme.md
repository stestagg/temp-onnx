contains test cases and code for various optimizers used in the project. It includes test cases for the AdamW optimizer, which tests the optimization process for both single and multiple weights scenarios. The directory also contains test cases for the InplaceClipGradNorm optimizer, which tests the functionality of clipping gradients to a maximum norm value. Additionally, the directory includes code for the AdamW optimizer test loop, which defines functions for setting up test inputs, running the optimizer, and validating the outputs. The directory also contains test cases for the SGD optimizer, which tests the optimization process for single and multiple weights with different update signals and iterations. Overall, the "optimizer" directory plays a crucial role in testing and validating the functionality of various optimizers used in the project.
