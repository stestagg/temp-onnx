contains test cases and code for various operations and functions implemented in the CUDA kernel of the project. It includes test cases for activation functions, batch normalization, dropout, convolution, cross entropy, fake quantization, gather elements, layer normalization, mixed precision scaling, negative log likelihood loss, reduce sum, scaling, softmax, and view operations. These tests cover different input dimensions, data types, and scenarios to ensure the correctness and performance of the CUDA implementation. The directory also includes a subdirectory called "optimizer" which contains test cases and code for various optimizers used in the project, such as AdamW, InplaceClipGradNorm, and SGD. The "cuda" directory plays a crucial role in testing and validating the functionality of the CUDA kernel and optimizers used in the project.
