in the project contains unit tests for various core functionalities related to training and checkpointing. It includes tests for saving and loading ONNX models and optimizer states as checkpoints, as well as comparing loaded values with the original ones for correctness. Additionally, there are tests for the training API module, optimizer, learning rate scheduler, and model export functionality. These tests cover scenarios such as module parameter size, copying buffers to parameters, training steps, optimizer creation, learning rate scheduling, and model export for inferencing. The tests are run on both CPU and CUDA execution providers.
