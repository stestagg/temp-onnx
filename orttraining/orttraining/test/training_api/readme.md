contains the main program for training a machine learning model using the ONNX Runtime Training API. It handles the configuration of the training process, initialization of the training session, and execution of the training loop. The code supports loading pre-trained models, evaluating the model during training, saving checkpoints, and updating the learning rate. It can handle both real and synthetic training data with different input types. Additionally, it provides the functionality to save the trained model weights to an output directory. The "core" subdirectory contains unit tests for various core functionalities related to training and checkpointing, including saving and loading ONNX models and optimizer states as checkpoints. The "common" subdirectory contains the implementation of a synthetic data loader used for generating random input data of various types and shapes for training purposes.
