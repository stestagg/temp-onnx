contains the implementation of various classes for performing neural network operations using GPU acceleration. It includes classes for computing gradients of batch normalization and convolution operations. The batch normalization classes use the ROCm library for GPU acceleration and support different data types. The convolution class uses the MIOpen library and provides functionality for computing gradients with respect to input data, weights, and bias. The classes handle input validation, data conversion, and memory allocation as needed. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient and optimized neural network computations in the project.
