covers the functionality related to convolution and batch normalization operations in the ROCm (AMD GPU) execution provider of the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes implementations for gradient computation of convolution and batch normalization, as well as internal batch normalization operations. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary header files, using common functions and types from the ONNX Runtime library, and utilizing ROCm-specific math and tensor operations. It also uses the miopen library for GPU-accelerated computations and the BatchNormHelper class from the CPU execution provider for validation. The computed gradients are stored in output tensors for further computations or updates.
