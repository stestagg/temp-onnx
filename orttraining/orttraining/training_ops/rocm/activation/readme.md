covers the functionality of computing the gradient of the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation function in ROCm for training operations in ONNX Runtime. It provides implementations for two template functions that compute the GELU gradient using different computation modes. The code interacts with other parts of the project through includes of necessary headers and namespaces, relying on dependencies from the ROCm provider and the CPU activation operations in the training_ops module. This code contributes to the implementation of GELU gradient computation in the ONNX Runtime Training project, specifically for the ROCm platform.
