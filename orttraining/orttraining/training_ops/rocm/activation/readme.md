contains the implementation of the ComputeGeluGradScalar function for the ROCm platform. This function computes the gradient of the Gelu activation function with respect to the input scalar value. It provides two different implementations, Default and Approximation, based on the specified computation mode. The Default mode uses mathematical functions to compute the gradient, while the Approximation mode uses a custom approximation algorithm. This directory is responsible for handling the activation functionality of the project on the ROCm platform.
