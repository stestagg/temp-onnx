covers the functionality of computing the gradient for the division operation in the ONNX Runtime Training library. It implements the DivGrad kernel, which is responsible for calculating the gradients of the division operation with respect to its inputs. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, using namespaces, defining typed kernels, and utilizing functions and classes from related directories. It also prepares input tensors, performs type conversions, allocates memory buffers, and updates output tensors.
