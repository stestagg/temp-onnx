contains the implementation of reduction operations for the ROCm execution provider in the project. It includes the ReduceAllL2 operation, which computes the L2-norm of a group of input tensors and returns the result as an output tensor. The implementation supports various data types and includes both deterministic and non-deterministic paths for computing the L2-norm. The code utilizes the ROCm library for efficient computation and memory management.
