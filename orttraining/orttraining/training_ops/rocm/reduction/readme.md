covers the functionality of reduction operations for the ROCm execution provider in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes implementations for reducing tensors using the L2-norm and performing reduction computations on input tensors based on specified reduction axes. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, using functions and types from those headers, and utilizing functions and classes from the ONNX Runtime and ROCm execution provider libraries.
