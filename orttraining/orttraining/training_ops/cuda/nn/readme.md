in the project contains the CUDA implementations for various operations used in training deep neural networks. It includes files for computing the gradients of batch normalization, convolution, and dropout operations. The code utilizes the cuDNN library for efficient GPU acceleration and supports different data types. Additionally, the directory includes files for gradient computation of layer normalization operations, with optimizations for performance using shared memory and warp-level reductions. Overall, the "nn" directory plays a crucial role in providing GPU-accelerated implementations for key operations in the project's deep neural network training pipeline.
