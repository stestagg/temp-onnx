contains the implementation of various CUDA operations for tensor manipulation in the project. It includes classes and functions for concatenating multiple input tensors, computing the gradient of gather and gather_nd operations, splitting a tensor into multiple output tensors, and reshaping/reinterpreting tensors. The implementations utilize CUDA libraries and optimizations for efficient computation on the GPU.
