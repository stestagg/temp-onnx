contains the CUDA kernels implementation for a Python operator in the project. It defines the ComputeInternal function for both the forward and backward passes of the operator. The forward pass runs the operator and sets the outputs, while the backward pass runs the gradient computation and sets the outputs. The directory also includes the RefCountTracker, which is used to track memory references.
