contains the implementation of encoding and decoding operations for the Gist project. These operations include binarization, packing, and unpacking of data. The code is specific to the CUDA execution provider and supports different data types such as float, MLFloat16, double, and bool. The directory also includes CUDA implementations for encoding and decoding operations, including specialized packing algorithms like Msfp15. The implementations are specialized for different data types such as float, half, and double.
