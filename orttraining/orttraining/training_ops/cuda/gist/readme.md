covers the implementation of CUDA kernels for the Gist encoding and decoding operations, which are used in the Gist compression algorithm. It includes functions for binarizing, packing, and unpacking tensors. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, using common CUDA functions and macros, and utilizing classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime Training project.
