covers the functionality of fake quantization and gradient computation operations in the ONNX Runtime Training project, specifically for CUDA devices. It includes the implementation of the FakeQuant and FakeQuantGrad classes, which perform fake quantization and gradient computation respectively. The code interacts with other parts of the project through the OpKernelContext class and the FakeQuantPerTensor function. It also registers the FakeQuant and FakeQuantGrad kernels with the ONNX Runtime framework. The code in this directory is responsible for quantization during training and interacts with other components of the project for further processing or analysis.
