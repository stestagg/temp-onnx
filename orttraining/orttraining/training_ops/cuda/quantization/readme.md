contains the CUDA implementation of quantization operations for the ONNX Runtime training models. It includes the implementation of FakeQuant and FakeQuantGrad operations, which are used for quantization and gradient computation in training models. The code registers the kernel for these operations and defines the computation logic for each operation. The implementation includes functions for quantizing input data, computing quantization masks, and computing gradients of quantized input data. This directory plays a crucial role in enabling quantization functionality in the project.
