covers the functionality related to control flow operations in the CUDA execution provider of the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes implementations of operators such as WaitEvent, RecordEvent, Group, PassThrough, and YieldOp. These operators are used for waiting for events, recording events, grouping tensors based on boolean values, passing tensors through without modification, and yielding during control flow operations in the training process. The code interacts with other parts of the project by reusing CPU helper functions, copying tensors, including necessary header files, and registering the operators with the ONNX operator kernel registry.
