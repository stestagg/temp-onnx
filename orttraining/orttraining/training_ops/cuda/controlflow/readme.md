contains the implementation of CUDA operators for control flow and data manipulation tasks in the project. It includes operators for group and pass-through operations, recording events, waiting for events to complete, and yielding control to the parent graph during execution. These operators are crucial for managing control flow and data manipulation in the CUDA execution provider of the project. The code also includes functionality for profiling using NVTX to measure the time taken by certain operations.
