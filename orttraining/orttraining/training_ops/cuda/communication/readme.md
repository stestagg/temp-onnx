the functionality of communication between GPUs in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes the implementation of the Send operator, which sends tensors from one GPU to another GPU. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers and using functions and classes from the CUDA and MPI contexts. It handles memory allocation, data copying, and communication setup using either NCCL or MPI. Additionally, it implements the NCCL service for planning and executing NCCL tasks, such as sending and receiving data between peers. The code also includes the implementation of the Recv class, which is responsible for receiving data from a specific source in a distributed training scenario. It interacts with other parts of the project by using functions and classes from the CUDA and MPI communication libraries, as well as the ONNX Runtime Training framework.
