in the project "orttraining" contains files that implement the functionality for communication tasks using the NCCL library for GPU-to-GPU communication. It includes the implementation of the NCCL service, which provides methods for planning and executing communication tasks between peers. Additionally, it contains the implementation of the Recv class for receiving data from a remote process and the Send operator for sending data between CUDA devices. These files handle tasks such as data copying, memory allocation, and communication setup, and support synchronization and task scheduling.
