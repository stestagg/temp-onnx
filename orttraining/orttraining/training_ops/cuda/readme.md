contains the implementation of various CUDA training kernels for the project. These kernels are used for operations such as view, group, pass-through, optimizer, reduction, split, concat, and many others. It also includes kernels for Adam and Lamb optimizers, gradient accumulation, softmax cross-entropy, layer normalization, convolution gradient, and other operations. Additionally, it includes kernels for P2P communication and event handling. The directory also includes subdirectories for specific functionality such as quantization, reduction, encoding/decoding, tensor manipulation, control flow, loss computation, mathematical operations, activation functions, collective communication, neural network operations, communication tasks, and optimization algorithms. Each subdirectory focuses on providing efficient CUDA implementations for the corresponding functionality, utilizing libraries and optimizations for GPU acceleration. Overall, the "cuda" directory plays a crucial role in enabling GPU-accelerated training and optimization of deep neural networks in the project.
