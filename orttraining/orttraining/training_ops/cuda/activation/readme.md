covers the functionality of computing the gradient of various activation functions in the CUDA execution provider of the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes implementations for activation gradient operators such as GeluGrad, FastGeluGrad, ReluGrad, SigmoidGrad, QuickGeluGrad, and TanhGrad. The code interacts with other parts of the project through the inclusion of necessary headers and the usage of classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime framework. It also includes CUDA kernels and utility functions for efficient computation on the GPU.
