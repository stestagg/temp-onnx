contains CUDA implementations for computing the Softmax Cross Entropy Loss and its gradient in the project. It provides efficient GPU-based operations for multi-class classification problems using the softmax activation function and cross entropy loss. The implementations support various data types, include optimizations for GPU acceleration, and handle weighted labels and ignoring certain indices. The directory includes files for dense and sparse inputs, specialized kernels for float data type, and functions for deep learning computations on GPUs.
