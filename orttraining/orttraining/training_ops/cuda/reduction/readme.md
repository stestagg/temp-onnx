contains the implementation of various reduction operations for training in the CUDA execution provider of the project. It includes CUDA kernels for performing reduction operations on tensors, such as computing the L2-norm and checking if all elements in a tensor are true. The code supports different data types and utilizes parallel execution on the GPU for efficient computation. The directory also includes implementations for reducing multi-dimensional tensors and utilizes libraries like Thrust and cuDNN for optimized tensor reduction.
