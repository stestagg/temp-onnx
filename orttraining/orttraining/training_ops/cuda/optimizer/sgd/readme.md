contains the implementation of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization algorithm for training operations in a CUDA environment. It includes the SGDOptimizerV2 class, which performs the optimization process by preparing data and parameters, and using a multi-tensor functor. The "sgd_impl.cu" file provides a kernel function for computing the SGD update on weight and gradient chunks, as well as a functor for invoking the kernel on a CUDA stream. This directory is responsible for optimizing weights during training using the SGD algorithm on CUDA devices.
