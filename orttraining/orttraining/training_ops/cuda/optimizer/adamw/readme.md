contains the implementation of the AdamW optimizer for optimizing model weights using the AdamW optimization algorithm on CUDA-enabled devices. It includes the implementation of the AdamWOptimizer class, which performs the optimization process by updating the weights, momentums, and learning rate. The directory also includes different modes of computation, weight decay, computation of historical gradients and squared gradients, and template instantiations for different data types. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in the project by providing functionality for training neural networks on CUDA-enabled GPUs using the AdamW optimization algorithm.
