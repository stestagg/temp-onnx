the functionality of clipping the gradient norm during training in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes CUDA kernels for clipping the gradients based on a specified max norm, as well as computation of the L2 norm of a group of gradients. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using common CUDA functions and data structures, functions and classes from the CUDA optimizer and reduction modules, and the TensorSeq class for handling input and output tensors. The computed clipped gradients are stored in the output tensor sequence.
