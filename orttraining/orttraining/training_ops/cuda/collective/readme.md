contains code related to collective communication and reduction operations for the CUDA execution provider in the project. It includes implementations of the AdasumAllReduce operation, as well as CUDA kernels for performing all-reduce, all-gather, and reduce-scatter operations using the NCCL library. These operations are used for synchronizing gradients and parameters across multiple GPUs during the distributed training process. The code handles tensor sizes, buffer lengths, memory copies between GPU and CPU, and utilizes the Adasum reducer and NCCL library for efficient communication and synchronization.
