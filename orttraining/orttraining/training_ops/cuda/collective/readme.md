covers the functionality related to collective operations, such as all-reduce and all-gather, for the CUDA execution provider in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes operators for enforcing type constraints on input tensors and implementing the AdasumAllReduce and NCCL operations. The code interacts with other parts of the project through the ONNX Runtime framework, OpKernelContext, and NcclKernel base class, and uses CUDA functions and MPI for memory operations and communication.
