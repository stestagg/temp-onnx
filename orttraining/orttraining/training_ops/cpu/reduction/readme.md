covers the functionality of performing reduction operations on the CPU execution provider in the ONNX Runtime Training project. Specifically, it includes the implementation for the ReduceAllL2 and ReduceSumTraining operations. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, defining typed kernels, accessing input and output tensors using OpKernelContext, and registering kernels for different data types.
