contains the implementation of reduction operations for the CPU execution provider in the onnxruntime library. It includes the kernel for the ReduceAllL2 operation, which computes the L2 norm of input tensors, and the implementation of the ReduceSumTraining operation, which performs reduction by summing tensors along specified axes. These operations are essential for various mathematical computations and data analysis tasks in the project.
