contains the implementation of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer for training neural networks in the project. It provides functions to prepare for computation and perform the optimization process. The optimizer updates the weights of the neural network based on the gradients of the loss function. The code ensures that the number of weights, gradients, and momentums match, and performs the weight update using the learning rate and gradient values. Additionally, the directory includes the definition of the SGD optimizer as an ONNX operator kernel.
