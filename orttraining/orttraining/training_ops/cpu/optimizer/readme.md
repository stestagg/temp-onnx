the functionality of optimizers for training neural networks, specifically the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer and the Adam optimizer. It includes classes for computing weight updates based on gradients and learning rate, and implements the SGD and Adam optimization algorithms. The code interacts with other parts of the system by including necessary headers, using functions and classes from the ONNX Runtime Training framework and the CPU provider, and registering the optimizers as custom operators in the ONNX Runtime framework. It also relies on the OpKernelContext and Tensor classes to manipulate tensors and perform element-wise operations.
