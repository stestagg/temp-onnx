contains the implementation of various optimizers and related functionality for training machine learning models in the project. It includes files for copying tensor values, gradient control and accumulation, and specific optimizers such as SGDOptimizer and AdamOptimizer. The "adamw" subdirectory implements the AdamWOptimizer class for weight optimization, while the "clip_grad_norm" subdirectory provides functionality for clipping the gradient norm. The "sgd" subdirectory focuses on the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, including computation preparation and weight update. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in optimizing the training process and ensuring proper weight updates in the project.
