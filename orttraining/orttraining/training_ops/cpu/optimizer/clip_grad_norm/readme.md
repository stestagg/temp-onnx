contains the implementation of a function that clips the gradient norm of a sequence of tensors. This functionality is important for optimizing the training process in the project. It calculates the L2 norm of the gradients, applies a clipping coefficient to each gradient tensor, and populates the output sequence with the clipped gradients. This directory plays a crucial role in ensuring that the gradients are properly controlled and optimized during training.
