Summary:
The code in this directory implements the InplaceClipGradNorm operator for clipping the gradient norm during training in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It interacts with other parts of the project by including headers from the ONNX Runtime framework and the training_ops module, using functions from the CPU provider and math libraries, defining helper functions for calculating the L2 norm of gradients and clipping the gradients based on a maximum norm value, populating the output tensor sequence with the clipped gradients, and registering the InplaceClipGradNorm operator as a kernel with the ONNX Runtime framework.
