contains the implementation of the GistBinarizeDecoderOp and GistBinarizeEncoderOp classes, which are responsible for converting binary tensors to float tensors and performing binarization encoding on input data, respectively. These classes are part of the training_ops module and are executed on the CPU execution provider. The GistBinarizeDecoderOp class checks the shape of the binary input tensor and converts each element to either 1.0 or 0.0 based on its value. The GistBinarizeEncoderOp class applies a binarization operation on the input tensor and produces two output tensors: one with the binarized values and another with boolean values indicating whether each element is greater than zero.
