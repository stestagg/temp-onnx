covers the functionality of encoding and decoding input data using a binarization technique. It includes the implementation of custom ONNX operator kernels for the encoding and decoding operations. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers and namespaces from the ONNX Runtime library. It also uses the OpKernelContext class to access input and output tensors. The encoding code contributes to the training operations for the CPU execution provider in the ONNX Runtime Training project.
