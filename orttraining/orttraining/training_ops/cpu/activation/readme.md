contains the implementation of the GeluGrad and BiasGeluGrad_dX operators for the CPU execution provider in the project. These operators are responsible for computing the gradients of the Gelu and BiasGelu activation functions, respectively. The GeluGrad operator computes the gradient of the Gelu function, while the BiasGeluGrad_dX operator computes the gradient of the BiasGelu function with respect to the input. The implementation includes different computation modes for Gelu, including a default mode and an approximation mode. The operators are defined as ONNX operators and utilize the Eigen library for efficient computation.
