covers the functionality of computing gradients for various activation functions used in training neural networks, including Gelu and FastGelu. It also includes the bias versions of these activation functions. The code interacts with other parts of the project by defining and registering the corresponding ONNX operators for these activation functions. It also includes helper functions for computing gradients using different computation modes.
