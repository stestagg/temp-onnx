contains the implementation of the FakeQuant and FakeQuantGrad operations for quantization in the project. These operations are responsible for quantizing the input tensor based on a given scale and zero point, as well as computing the gradient with respect to the output and the gradient mask input. The quantization functionality is a significant feature of the project, allowing for precise and efficient numerical representation of data.
