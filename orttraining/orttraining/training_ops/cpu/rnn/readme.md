covers the functionality of training and computing gradients for the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes implementations for the LSTMGrad operator and the LSTMTraining class. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using input and output tensors, accessing weights and buffers, utilizing a thread pool and allocator for memory management, and including necessary header files and classes from other files in the project.
