contains the implementation of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) operations for training and gradient computation in a deep learning model. It includes classes such as LSTMTraining and LSTMGrad, which handle the computation and gradient calculation for the LSTM operation. The directory also includes helper functions and classes from the rnn namespace to facilitate the LSTM computation. The code supports both uni-directional and bi-directional LSTM models, with configurable activation functions. The implementation involves initializing the LSTM model, computing hidden states and cell states, updating final states, and calculating gradients of input, weights, recurrence weights, bias, and peephole weights with respect to the loss function.
