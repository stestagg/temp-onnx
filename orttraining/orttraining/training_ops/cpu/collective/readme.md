contains the implementation of the AdasumAllReduce operator, which is a key component of the larger system architecture for distributed training in the project. This operator performs an all-reduce operation on a set of input tensors using the Adasum algorithm. It utilizes MPI for communication and allocates temporary buffers to store intermediate results. The "collective" directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient collective operations for distributed training in the project.
