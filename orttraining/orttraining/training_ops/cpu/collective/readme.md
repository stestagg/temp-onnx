implements the AdasumAllReduce operator for distributed training in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It performs an all-reduce operation on a set of input tensors using the Adasum algorithm. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including headers from the MPI communication module and the communication_common module, defining the operator as an ONNX operator kernel, computing the size and buffer length of the input tensors using a helper function, allocating temporary memory buffers, calling the DispatchFusedAllreduce function to perform the all-reduce operation, and retrieving the output tensors from the context.
