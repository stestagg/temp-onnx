covers the functionality of custom Torch operations in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes the implementation of custom operators for executing forward and backward computations in a neural network training process. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime Training framework, Torch Proxy, and Torch Python API. It also includes kernel registration to register the custom operators with the ONNX Runtime Training framework.
