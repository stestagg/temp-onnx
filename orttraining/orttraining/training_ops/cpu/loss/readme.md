contains the implementation of operations related to computing loss and gradients in machine learning models. It includes functions for computing softmax probabilities, cross entropy loss, and gradients using CPU operations. The files "cross_entropy.cc" and "softmax_cross_entropy_loss.cc" provide the implementation for Softmax Cross Entropy and Sparse Softmax Cross Entropy operations, as well as the computation of loss and gradients for a given input tensor. These operations are crucial for training machine learning models and updating the input tensor during the training process.
