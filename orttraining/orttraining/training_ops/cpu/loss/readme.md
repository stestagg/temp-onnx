covers the functionality of implementing the Softmax Cross Entropy Loss operation for training neural networks using the ONNX Runtime Training framework. It includes kernel functions for different data types and versions of the operation, helper functions for verifying input tensor shapes, and calculating the output tensor shape and permutation. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary header files, using functions and classes from the ONNX Runtime Training framework, and functions from the Eigen library for mathematical computations. It also interacts with other functional areas by including utility functions from the math library and defining the SoftmaxCrossEntropy kernel for the CPU execution provider.
