contains the implementation of the Recv and Send classes, which are responsible for handling communication between nodes in a distributed training system. The Recv class receives data through MPI communication, copying it into the corresponding output tensors and handling shape inference. The Send operator uses MPI to send tensors from one node to another, aggregating them into a buffer and sending it to the specified destination node. It also handles shape information communication when shape inference is not possible. This directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient communication and data exchange between nodes during distributed training.
