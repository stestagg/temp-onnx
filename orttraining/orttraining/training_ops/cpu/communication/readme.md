covers the functionality of sending and receiving tensors for communication in distributed training using MPI. It includes the implementation of the Send and Recv operators, which are responsible for sending and receiving data between ranks. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers and dependencies for MPI communication, and it also relies on the MPI context for configuration. Additionally, the code interacts with the communication, framework, and training_ops components of the project through includes and dependencies.
