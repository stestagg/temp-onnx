contains the implementation of the Scale operator for the CPU execution provider in the ONNX Runtime Training framework. This operator scales the input tensor by a specified scale value, which can be a single value or a tensor with a single value. The implementation supports different data types for the input and scale value, such as float, double, int64, and int32. It utilizes Eigen, a C++ template library for linear algebra, to efficiently perform the scaling operation.
