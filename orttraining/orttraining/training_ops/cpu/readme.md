contains the implementation of various CPU training kernels for the project. These kernels are responsible for performing operations such as optimization, gradient calculation, normalization, pooling, and more. It also includes the registration of these kernels in the kernel registry. Additionally, the directory includes the implementation of operators for generating summary data, quantization operations, custom Python operators, activation functions, optimizers, tensor manipulation and computation, LSTM operations, reduction operations, collective operations for distributed training, control flow operations, binarization encoding and decoding, neural network training operations, scaling operations, loss computation operations, and communication operations for distributed training. Overall, the "cpu" directory plays a crucial role in providing a wide range of functionality related to training and computation in the project.
