contains the implementation of various operations and operators related to neural network training. It includes files for batch normalization, convolutional layer gradients, dropout, layer normalization, and pool gradient operations. These files define the computation and gradient computation for these operations, which are essential for training neural networks. The code supports different data types, handles different pooling dimensions, and uses linear algebra libraries for efficient computations. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in providing the necessary functionality for training neural networks in the project.
