in the project contains files that implement various control flow operations and functionalities for the CPU execution provider. These files include the implementation of an event pool class for managing events, operations for group computation and passing through tensors, recording events in tensors, waiting for specific events, and a yield operator. These functionalities ensure proper synchronization, execution order, and event handling within the project.
