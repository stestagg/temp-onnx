implements operations for generating summary data for TensorBoard visualization during training. It defines ONNX operators for computing and serializing summary data in the form of protobuf messages. The operators include SummaryScalar, SummaryHistogram, SummaryMerge, and SummaryText. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using the ONNX Runtime framework and its CPU execution provider. It also has dependencies on other header files and protobuf libraries.
