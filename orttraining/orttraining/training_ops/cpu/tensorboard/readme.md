contains the implementation of operators for generating summary data in the TensorFlow project. These operators, such as SummaryScalar, SummaryHistogram, SummaryMerge, and SummaryText, are used to compute and merge summary data for scalar values, histograms, and text data. The summary data is serialized as a protobuf and can be used for visualization and analysis purposes in the project.
