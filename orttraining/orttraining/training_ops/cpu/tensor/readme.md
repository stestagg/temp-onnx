the functionality related to tensor operations for the CPU execution provider in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes implementations for operators such as SplitTraining, ConcatTraining, GatherGrad, SliceGrad, GatherNDGrad, and GatherElementsGrad. These operators are used for tasks such as splitting tensors, concatenating tensors, computing gradients, and gathering elements from tensors. The code interacts with other parts of the system by including necessary headers, using common utility functions, and being registered as kernels for the corresponding operators. It also interacts with the ONNX Runtime library for tensor operations and thread pooling.
