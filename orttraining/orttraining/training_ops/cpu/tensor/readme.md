contains the implementation of various operators and classes related to tensor manipulation and computation for the project. It includes functionalities such as concatenating multiple input tensors into a single output tensor, gathering elements from a tensor based on indices, computing gradients for backpropagation, slicing tensors, and splitting tensors along a specified axis. The implementations support different data types and utilize efficient computation techniques for optimal performance. These functionalities are crucial for tasks such as neural network training and data parallelism in the project.
