contains the implementation of various functionalities related to training machine learning models in the project. It includes files for saving and loading checkpoints, managing properties for checkpointing, implementing a linear learning rate scheduler, training and evaluating models using the Module class, training APIs for creating sessions and managing parameters, implementing an optimizer for model training, and managing the training process using the TrainingSession class. Additionally, it includes utility functions for the training API, such as retrieving input and output names, creating tensors, and copying tensors to TensorProto format.
