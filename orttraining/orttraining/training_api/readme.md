covers the functionality of the ONNX Runtime Training API. It includes utility functions for handling input and output names, parameter extraction, and tensor operations. It also defines classes for managing checkpoints, training sessions, optimizers, and learning rate schedulers. The code interacts with other parts of the system by including headers from the ONNX Runtime and ONNX libraries, as well as core platform and framework libraries. It also interacts with namespaces, member variables, and functions from other components within the training API, such as the PropertyBag, Environment, SessionOptions, IExecutionProvider, CheckpointState, ModelIdentifiers, Module, and Optimizer classes.
