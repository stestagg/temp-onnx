covers the functionality of training a BERT model using the ONNX Runtime Training framework. It includes header files specific to the BERT model and defines structs for session options, BERT parameters, and ONNX parameters. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including various header files from the ONNX Runtime Training framework and calling functions from the TrainingRunner object to start the training process.
