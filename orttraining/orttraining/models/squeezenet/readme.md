covers the functionality of training the SqueezeNet model using ONNX Runtime Training. It interacts with other parts of the project to load training and test data, configure training parameters, and perform the training process. The code initializes the logging manager and environment for ONNX Runtime, loads data using the DataLoader class, sets training parameters, defines an error function, and calls the TrainingRunner class to start the training process. The trained model is saved to the specified output directory.
