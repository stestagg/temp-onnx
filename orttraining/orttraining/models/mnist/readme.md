contains code related to training a machine learning model on the MNIST dataset. It includes the main program for training, which handles command line arguments, training parameters, data preparation, and starting the training session. The directory also includes functions for normalizing and converting the MNIST dataset, as well as loading a pre-trained model, generating a gradient graph for training, and saving the transformed model with updated weights, loss function, and gradients. The code utilizes the onnxruntime library and provides functionality for logging, tensorboard integration, and distributed training.
