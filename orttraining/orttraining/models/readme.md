contains subdirectories for different machine learning models used in the project. Each subdirectory contains the main program for training a specific model, handling command line arguments, setting up training parameters, and running the training process. The models directory supports various features such as mixed precision training, gradient accumulation, distributed training using MPI, and GPU acceleration. It also includes functionality for logging training progress and performance metrics to TensorBoard. Additionally, the directory provides utility functions for dataset manipulation, checkpoint saving and loading, and measuring performance metrics during training.
