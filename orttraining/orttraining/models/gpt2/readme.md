contains the main program for training a GPT-2 model in the project. It handles parsing command line arguments, setting up training parameters, and running the training or performance test based on the specified mode. The program utilizes the ONNX Runtime library for model training and offers options for mixed precision training, gradient accumulation, and distributed training using MPI. Additionally, it supports logging training progress and performance metrics to TensorBoard.
