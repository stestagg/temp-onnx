covers the main program for training the GPT-2 model using the ONNX Runtime Training framework. It includes header files, defines structs for training and logging parameters, parses command-line arguments, sets up the training environment, initializes the training session, and runs the training process. It also includes CUDA and ROCM specific code for GPU allocation. This code interacts with other parts of the project by including various header files and using classes and functions from those files.
