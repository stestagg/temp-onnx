covers the functionality related to loading and managing training data, running the training process, and handling various parameters and configurations for the ONNX Runtime Training project. The DataLoader class loads and preprocesses data files, while the DataSet class manages training data. The TrainingRunner class creates and manages a training session, performs optimizations, and executes training steps. These classes interact with other parts of the project, such as the ONNX Runtime library, logging, file I/O, and the ONNX namespace, to utilize utility functions, handle tensor data, and access training framework classes and functions.
