contains the implementation of various classes and utility functions that are essential for training a machine learning model in the project. It includes a DataLoader class for loading and managing training data, a TrainingRunner class for handling the training loop and model evaluation, and utility functions for dataset manipulation, shuffling data, printing tensors, and creating learning rate schedulers. The directory supports various training configurations such as distributed training, mixed precision training, and pipeline parallelism. It also provides functionality for saving and loading checkpoints, as well as measuring performance metrics during training.
