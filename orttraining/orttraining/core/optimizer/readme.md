covers various optimization techniques for the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes fusion of operations, rewriting rules, replacement of nodes, memory optimization, graph transformation, and shape optimization. The code interacts with other parts of the system by using classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime Training framework, manipulating the graph structure, checking node types and attributes, accessing input and output arguments, and traversing the graph. It also interacts with utility functions and modules to analyze and modify the graph, handle data types, and output debug information.
