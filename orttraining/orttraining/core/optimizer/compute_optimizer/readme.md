in the project is responsible for implementing various optimizations related to computation in the graph. It includes the PaddingElimination optimization, which eliminates padding in the input data by reshaping, gathering, and scattering operations. This optimization improves performance and reduces memory usage. Additionally, the directory contains the implementation of a compute optimization for inserting a Gather node before a SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss node. This optimization filters out invalid tokens from the label input and improves the efficiency of the graph by reducing unnecessary computations.
