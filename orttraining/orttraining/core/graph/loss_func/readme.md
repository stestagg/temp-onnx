the functionality of computing various loss functions used in training a BERT model, including the BertLoss, SoftmaxCrossEntropy, SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropy, and MeanSquaredError classes. These classes are responsible for augmenting the computational graph with nodes and type prototypes for calculating the loss. The code interacts with other parts of the system by using classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime and GraphAugmenter libraries, such as Graph, NodeArg, and TypeProto, to access and manipulate the graph. It also relies on graph definitions and node arguments from the input graph, and creates new nodes and type prototypes to augment the graph with the loss computation.
