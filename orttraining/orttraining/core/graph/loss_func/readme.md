contains code related to loss functions in the BERT model. It includes implementations of the BertLoss and BertLossLegacy classes, which calculate the total loss in a BERT model by adding nodes to the graph. The directory also includes the MeanSquaredError class, which adds nodes to calculate the mean squared error loss function. Additionally, there are implementations of three different loss functions: SoftmaxCrossEntropy, SparseSoftmaxCrossEntropy, and SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss. These loss functions are used in the training process of a machine learning model. The directory also defines a function called "GetSparseTypeProto" that creates a TypeProto object for sparse tensors.
