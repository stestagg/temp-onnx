the functionality of building optimizers for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Lamb in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes classes such as SGDOptimizerBuilder, AdamOptimizerBuilder, and LambOptimizerBuilder, which are responsible for constructing the necessary nodes, inputs, and outputs in the graph for each optimizer. The code interacts with other parts of the project, such as the GraphAugmenter class and various data structures and utility functions, to add inputs, outputs, and initializers to the graph, handle gradient clipping, and update the step count during training iterations.
