contains various files that are responsible for building and manipulating the optimizer graph in the training module of the project. These files include implementations for different optimizer graph builders, gradient builders for mathematical operations, a graph augmenter for modifying the graph structure, and a mixed-precision transformer for converting arithmetic precision. Additionally, there are files for building loss functions, registering gradient builders, and handling optimizer builders. The directory also includes subdirectories for loss functions and optimizer builders, which contain specific implementations for different loss functions and optimizers used in training neural networks.
