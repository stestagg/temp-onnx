covers the functionality of the TrainingAgent class in the ONNX Runtime Training project. The TrainingAgent is responsible for running forward and backward passes during training. It interacts with other parts of the project, such as the InferenceSession, FeedsFetchesManager, PartialGraphExecutionState, and OrtValueCachePtr. It initializes the feeds and fetches managers, sets program counters, and executes the core training logic using the PartialRun method of the InferenceSession.
