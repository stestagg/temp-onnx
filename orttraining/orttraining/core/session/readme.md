in the project contains code related to the core functionality of the onnxruntime training module. It includes functions for copying and manipulating tensors, such as copying memory from GPU to CPU, creating CPU tensors, copying slices of tensors, and concatenating tensors along a specified axis. Additionally, it contains the implementation of the TrainingSession class, which is responsible for building and training a model. This includes functions for setting up the optimizer, building the loss function, and handling distributed training. Overall, the "session" directory plays a crucial role in the project by providing essential functionality for training models using the onnxruntime framework.
