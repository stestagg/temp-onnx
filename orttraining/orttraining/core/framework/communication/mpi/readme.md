Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality of MPI (Message Passing Interface) communication in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It provides utility functions for MPI communication, such as getting the MPI data type for a given MLDataType, and functions for managing the MPI context, including initializing the context, retrieving information about world size and rank, and creating parallel groups for communication. The code interacts with other parts of the project by being included in files that require MPI communication functionality, and by providing a singleton instance of the MPIContext class for other parts of the project to access and perform communication operations.
