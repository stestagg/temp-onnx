contains essential functionality for the core framework of the project. It includes files for creating OrtValues from TensorProto objects, managing checkpoints, saving and loading model checkpoints, organizing the distributed training environment, building gradient graphs, initializing and building forward and gradient graphs for modules, and scheduling pipeline operations. Additionally, it includes subdirectories for MPI communication, Adasum operations, Tensorboard visualization and analysis, and Torch framework-related code. These features play crucial roles in enabling efficient communication, computation, visualization, and analysis in the project.
