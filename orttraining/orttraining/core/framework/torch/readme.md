contains code related to the Torch framework in the project. It includes implementations for registering and retrieving Torch autograd functions and objects, converting between DLPack tensors and OrtValue tensors, tracking the reference count of Python objects, and invoking forward and backward operations in a PyTorch model. These functionalities are essential for the Torch framework's functionality in the project.
