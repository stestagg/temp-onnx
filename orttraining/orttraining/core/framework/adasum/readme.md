contains the implementation of the AdasumMPI class, which is responsible for initializing and performing communication operations using the MPI library. These operations are crucial for computing dot products and norms for tensors that are distributed across multiple ranks, as required for implementing the Adasum operation. The class also provides functions for obtaining the rank and size of a communicator, as well as performing allreduce and point-to-point send/receive operations. Overall, the "adasum" directory plays a vital role in enabling efficient distributed computation for the project.
