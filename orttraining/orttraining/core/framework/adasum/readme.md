covers the functionality of initializing and performing communication operations using MPI for the Adasum reduction algorithm. It includes the AdasumMPI class, which provides functions for computing dot products and norms of tensors split across multiple ranks. The code interacts with other parts of the project by utilizing the MPIContext and MPI communication groups to initialize communication groups for the Adasum reduction. It also provides functions for performing allreduce operations and point-to-point send/receive operations using MPI.
