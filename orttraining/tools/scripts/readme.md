contains various scripts that are used for different tasks in the project. These scripts include running Azure Machine Learning experiments for training a BERT model, optimizing and transforming models, performing layer normalization, converting models to a more optimized version, training BERT models for pretraining, upgrading models to a specific version, analyzing ONNX files, splitting models into subgraphs, running performance tests on BERT models, retrieving tensor data from a SQLite database, and syncing files from Azure Machine Learning experiments. These scripts cover a wide range of functionalities related to training, optimizing, analyzing, and managing models in the project.
