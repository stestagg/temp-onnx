covers various areas of functionality related to the ONNX Runtime Training project. It includes tools for running performance tests, batch size tests, convergence tests, and result comparison for BERT and GPT-2 training. It also includes scripts for running experiments using Azure Machine Learning, analyzing ONNX files, executing the training process, transforming ONNX models, measuring performance, splitting graph models, and monitoring AzureML experiments. Additionally, it covers the functionality of building a fully connected (FC) model for the MNIST dataset using the ONNX framework and setting up the environment to run ONNX Runtime Training with AMD GPU.

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by utilizing the ORT binary, training data, and model directories, executing the training processes, comparing results, and storing the performance and convergence test outputs. It also interacts with the "util" module for downloading and extracting Azure blob archives. Furthermore, it imports modules, uses command-line arguments, calls executables, manipulates ONNX models, and utilizes libraries and packages from the project.
