covers the functionality of setting up the environment to run ONNX Runtime Training with AMD GPU. It includes a Dockerfile for building a Docker image with necessary dependencies, installation of additional packages, configuration of Infiniband setup, and installation of UCX and OpenMPI. The resulting Docker image can be used as a containerized environment for running ONNX Runtime Training with AMD GPU.

The code in the subdirectory "./script" covers the functionality of running the BERT model training process using ONNX Runtime on AMD GPUs. It includes scripts for configuring and executing the training process, analyzing GPU profiling data, and a configuration file for the AMD GPU component. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using the ONNX Runtime Training executable, accessing the model and data directories, and writing logs to the log directory. It may also interact with other scripts or components for data preprocessing or post-processing tasks. The configuration file provides default values and metrics for the AMD GPU component used in training machine learning models.
