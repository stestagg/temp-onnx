covers the functionality of running the BERT model training process using ONNX Runtime on AMD GPUs. It includes a script to configure and execute the training process, a configuration file for the AMD GPU component, and a Python script for analyzing GPU profiling data. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using the ONNX Runtime Training executable, accessing the model and data directories, and writing logs to the log directory. It may also interact with other scripts or components for data preprocessing or post-processing tasks. Additionally, the configuration file provides default values and metrics for the AMD GPU component used in training machine learning models.
