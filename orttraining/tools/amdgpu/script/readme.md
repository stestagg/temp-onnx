contains files that are used for analyzing GPU activity logs and running training jobs for a BERT model. The "rocprof.py" script analyzes GPU activity logs by grouping and summarizing different types of activities. It extracts relevant lines of GPU activity, groups them based on predefined categories, and calculates statistics such as the number of calls and absolute time. The "run_bert.sh" shell script is used to run a training job for a BERT model. It sets up directories and files, executes the training job with specified parameters, and includes options for profiling and saving logs.
