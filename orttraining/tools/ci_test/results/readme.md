is responsible for storing and representing the convergence baseline results of a BERT model during training. It interacts with other parts of the project by being a part of the CI testing process and provides information about the training progress. Other components or scripts in the project may utilize these result files to analyze and visualize the training performance or make decisions based on the convergence of the model.
