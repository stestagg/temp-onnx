covers functionality related to running performance tests, batch size tests, convergence tests, and result comparison for BERT and GPT-2 training in the ONNX Runtime Training project. It interacts with other parts of the project by utilizing the ORT binary, training data, and model directories, executing the training processes, comparing results, and storing the performance and convergence test outputs. The code also interacts with the "util" module for downloading and extracting Azure blob archives. The results directory stores convergence baseline results for analysis and visualization purposes.
