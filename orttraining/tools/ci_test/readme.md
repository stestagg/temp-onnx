contains various scripts and files that are used for testing and evaluating the performance of machine learning models in the project. It includes scripts for comparing actual and expected results, running batch size and convergence tests for BERT and GPT-2 models, and downloading Azure blob archives. The directory also contains a "results" subdirectory that stores files for monitoring and analyzing the performance of the models and code execution. Overall, the "ci_test" directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of the machine learning models used in the project.
