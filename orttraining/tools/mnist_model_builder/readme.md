contains files that are responsible for building fully connected models for the MNIST dataset using the ONNX library. These files define the model architecture, initialize weights and biases, create computational graphs, and save the models as ONNX files. They also include functionality to check the validity of the models and demonstrate how to use them for inference by loading and running sample inputs. This directory plays a crucial role in the project by providing the necessary tools to build and use fully connected models for the MNIST dataset.
