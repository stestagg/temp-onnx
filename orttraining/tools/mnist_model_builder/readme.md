covers the functionality of building a fully connected (FC) model for the MNIST dataset using the ONNX framework. It defines the architecture of the model, initializes the weights and biases, and creates a graph representation of the model using ONNX helper functions. This code interacts with other functional areas of the system by providing a trained model that can be used for training and inference with the ONNX Runtime Training framework.
