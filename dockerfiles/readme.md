covers the functionality of building Docker images for running ONNXRuntime with various integrations and configurations, such as CPU, CUDA, CUDNN, ROCm, TensorRT, OpenVINO, Vitis-AI, and MIGraphX. It provides Dockerfiles for each integration, specifying the base image, installing dependencies, cloning the ONNXRuntime repository, building ONNXRuntime with the required configurations, and installing the built ONNXRuntime package. 

The code in this directory interacts with other functional areas of the system by pulling in the ONNXRuntime repository, installing necessary dependencies and packages specific to each integration, and setting up the environment variables and configurations required for running ONNX models with the respective integrations. It ensures that the correct versions of submodules are used and provides the necessary components for building and running the ONNX Runtime on different platforms.
