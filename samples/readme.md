contains code that is essential for the project's use of ONNX models in a Node.js environment. It includes functionality for loading and running ONNX models, creating tensors of different types and dimensions, and creating inference sessions from model files and buffers. This directory also includes code for training neural network models on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch and ONNX Runtime. It defines the model architecture, sets up data loaders, and performs the training loop. Additionally, it includes code for training and evaluating a PyTorch TransformerModel for natural language processing tasks. This directory plays a crucial role in executing, analyzing, and inferring ONNX models, as well as training and evaluating neural network models for image classification and language modeling tasks within the project.
