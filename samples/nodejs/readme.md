covers the basic usage of the ONNX Runtime Node.js package. It demonstrates how to create a new session, load an ONNX model, prepare inputs as tensors, feed the inputs to the model, run the inference, and read the results. The code interacts with the ONNX Runtime Node.js package by importing and using its functions and classes. It relies on the model.onnx file to load the specific model for inference.

Directory: ./02_create-tensor
Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality of creating various types of tensors using the ONNX Runtime library in Node.js. It demonstrates the creation of float, boolean, scaler, string, and one-dimensional tensors with different dimensions and data types. The code does not interact with other functional areas of the system as it is a standalone sample code showcasing the usage of the ONNX Runtime library for tensor creation.

Directory: ./04_create-inference-session
Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality of creating inference sessions from ONNX model files or buffers in Node.js. It uses the InferenceSession class from the onnxruntime library and interacts with other parts of the project by importing necessary modules and classes such as fs and util. The code also utilizes the options object to specify session options. The main() function is called to execute the code.
