contains a JavaScript script that uses the ONNX Runtime library to load and run an ONNX model. It handles the creation of a new session, prepares input tensors, feeds the inputs to the model, and retrieves the output tensor. The script then logs the data of the output tensor to the console. This functionality is essential for the project's use of ONNX models and allows for the execution and analysis of these models within the project.
