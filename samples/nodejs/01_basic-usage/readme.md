covers the basic usage of the ONNX Runtime Node.js package. It demonstrates how to create a new session, load an ONNX model, prepare inputs as tensors, feed the inputs to the model, run the inference, and read the results. The code interacts with the ONNX Runtime Node.js package by importing and using its functions and classes. It relies on the model.onnx file to load the specific model for inference.
