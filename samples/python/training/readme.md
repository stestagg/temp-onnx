covers the functionality of training and evaluating PyTorch Transformer models for natural language processing tasks. It includes modules for defining the model architecture, handling data processing and batch handling, and training the model using both PyTorch and ONNX Runtime frameworks. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by importing modules and functions from other files within the directory, as well as utilizing libraries such as torch.nn, torchtext, and ONNX Runtime. It also interacts with components that use the utility functions and model descriptions provided in this directory for training the PyTorch Transformer model.

Directory: ./mnist
Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality of training a neural network model on the MNIST dataset using ONNX Runtime as the backend on a CUDA device. It uses the PyTorch framework to define and train the model. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing modules from the onnxruntime and torchvision libraries. It also defines helper functions for training and testing the model. The main function parses command-line arguments for training settings and executes the training and testing processes. Additionally, the code utilizes the ONNX Runtime library for inference and the torchvision library for loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
