contains code for training neural network models on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch and ONNX Runtime. It includes two files: "ort_mnist.py" and "pytorch_mnist.py". These files define the model architecture, set up data loaders, and perform the training loop. They also allow for saving the trained model. Additionally, the directory includes code related to training and evaluating a PyTorch TransformerModel for natural language processing tasks. This code implements the main logic for training and evaluating the TransformerModel, including functions for setting up training settings, initializing the model and optimizer, and running the training and evaluation loops. It also includes functions for data preprocessing tasks such as tokenization and building a vocabulary. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in training and evaluating neural network models for both image classification and language modeling tasks.
