contains code for training neural network models on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch and ONNX Runtime. It includes two files: "ort_mnist.py" and "pytorch_mnist.py". 

"ort_mnist.py" defines the model architecture, sets up data loaders, and performs the training loop. It also allows for saving the trained model.

"pytorch_mnist.py" defines the model architecture, loss function, and training and testing functions. It sets up the training settings, loads the dataset, initializes the model and optimizer, and runs the training loop. It also provides the option to save the trained model.

Overall, this directory focuses on training and testing neural network models on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch and ONNX Runtime.
