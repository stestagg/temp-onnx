the functionality of training a neural network model on the MNIST dataset using ONNX Runtime as the backend on a CUDA device. It uses the PyTorch framework to define and train the model. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing modules from the onnxruntime and torchvision libraries. It also defines helper functions for training and testing the model. The main function parses command-line arguments for training settings and executes the training and testing processes. Additionally, the code utilizes the ONNX Runtime library for inference and the torchvision library for loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
