contains code that implements the backend API for ONNX in the project. It provides functions and classes to check model compatibility, prepare models for inference, and run models to compute predictions. The backend supports different devices for computation and can be used with multiple runtimes. The files in this directory handle compatibility checks, preparation, execution, and device support for the system architecture.
