contains code related to executing ATen operators in PyTorch. It includes a decorator function to ensure a function is only run once during execution, a function to load a C++ extension for executing ATen operators, and functions and data structures for executing the operators and handling operator arguments. This directory plays a crucial role in enabling the execution of ATen operators in PyTorch.
