contains code related to the integration of ONNX Runtime with PyTorch. It includes an implementation of a decorator that ensures a function is only executed once during runtime, regardless of the number of calls. Additionally, it provides a function for loading a C++ extension that enables the execution of ATen operators. These features contribute to the seamless integration and efficient execution of PyTorch models using ONNX Runtime.
