covers the functionality of setting up the build configuration for the ONNX Runtime Torch C++ extension. It initializes and loads the Aten Op Executor C++ extension in the ONNX Runtime project. It also includes functionality for executing ATen operators and uses the torch and ATen libraries for tensor operations and data type conversions.

Interactions:
- The code in setup.py interacts with other parts of the project by specifying the source file for the extension and the package name.
- The code in ort_torch_ext interacts with other parts of the project by importing necessary modules and functions, such as `torch` and `_C` from the `onnxruntime.capi` module.
- The code in aten_op_executor interacts with other parts of the project by importing modules and calling functions from those modules. It also uses the torch and ATen libraries for tensor operations and data type conversions.
