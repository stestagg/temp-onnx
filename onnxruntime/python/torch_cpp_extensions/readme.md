contains code related to setting up the build configuration for Torch extension modules. It includes the necessary imports and defines the extension module using a C++ source file. This directory also includes code for executing ATen operators in PyTorch and integrating ONNX Runtime with PyTorch. It provides functions and data structures for executing operators, handling operator arguments, and loading C++ extensions. These features contribute to the seamless integration and efficient execution of PyTorch models using ONNX Runtime.
