in the ONNX Runtime project implements a JIT (Just-In-Time) interface for importing and compiling frontend models. It provides packed functions for importing and compiling models using the ANSOR_TYPE and AUTO_TVM_TYPE. Additionally, it includes a script that extends a target file by appending code to import necessary modules and register functions for working with TVM EP (Execution Provider). There is also a file responsible for compiling an ONNX model into a TVM module, supporting various parameters such as the target device and optimization level. The file also allows tuning the model using either the Ansor or AutoTVM tuning methods.
