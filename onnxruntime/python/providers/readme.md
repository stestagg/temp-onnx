covers the functionality of compiling ONNX models using TVM and generating a TVM executor. It supports optimizations, tuning with AutoTVM or Ansor, and allows for specifying input shapes and target devices. The code interacts with other parts of the system by utilizing functions and classes from the ONNX, TVM, and AutoTVM libraries, as well as providing a JIT interface for importing and compiling frontend models.
