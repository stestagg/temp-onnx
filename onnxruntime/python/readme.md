in the ONNX Runtime project contains code and functionality related to the Python API and integration of the project. It includes files for preloading libraries during the building of a wheel, finding and retrieving versions of CUDA runtime and cudnn, working with ONNX models and running inference using the ONNX Runtime, defining exception handling functions and registering exception classes, binding inputs and outputs to an inference session, creating and manipulating OrtValue objects, defining Python bindings for the project, adding global schema functions and op kernel submodules, working with sparse tensors, converting ONNX Runtime tensor objects to Python objects, validating operating system requirements, and exporting a Python initialization function. The directory also includes subdirectories for implementing a JIT interface for importing and compiling frontend models, setting up the build configuration for Torch extension modules, and providing functionality for different aspects of the project such as offline tuning, testing, benchmarking, and working with example datasets. Additionally, the directory contains code for implementing the backend API for ONNX, which includes model compatibility checks, model preparation for inference, and model execution for computing predictions. The "training" subdirectory serves as a placeholder for the deployment process of the project's inference-only wheel.
