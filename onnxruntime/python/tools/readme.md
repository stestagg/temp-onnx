in the project contains various scripts, modules, and subdirectories that provide functionality for different aspects of the project. It includes files for offline tuning of ONNX files, declassification of ONNX models, testing ONNX models with ONNX Runtime, registering contrib ops with PyTorch-ONNX exporter, and performing symbolic shape inference. Additionally, the directory contains subdirectories for benchmarking the project's engine, creating custom operator wrappers, microbenchmarking operations, analyzing performance traces, quantizing ONNX models, and working with transformer models. Overall, the "tools" directory plays a crucial role in providing essential tools and functionality for the project's development, testing, optimization, and analysis.
