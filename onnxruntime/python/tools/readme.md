covers various areas of functionality related to the ONNX Runtime project. It includes tools for extracting, embedding, and merging tuning results in ONNX files, implementing symbolic shape inference for ONNX models, randomizing tensor data in ONNX models, registering ONNX Runtime's built-in contrib ops with the PyTorch-ONNX exporter, and testing ONNX models by loading and running them. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using the ONNX library, sympy library, numpy library, argparse, torch.onnx module, onnxruntime Python package, and numpy package. It also relies on the ONNX and transformers libraries for model manipulation and inference. The code in this directory plays a crucial role in optimizing, testing, and deploying ONNX models using the ONNX Runtime.
