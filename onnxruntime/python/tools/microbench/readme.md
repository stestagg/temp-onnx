contains code for benchmarking various operations in a neural network model using the ONNX Runtime. It includes files for benchmarking attention, casting operations, convolution operations, FastGelu operation, Layer Normalization operation, matrix multiplication operations, NHWC convolution operation, Skip Layer Normalization operation, Softmax operation, and TopK operation. Each file defines the parameters, creates inputs and outputs, and profiles the performance of the respective operation. The code supports different input sizes, precision formats, and hardware providers. The benchmark results are printed in a specific format.
