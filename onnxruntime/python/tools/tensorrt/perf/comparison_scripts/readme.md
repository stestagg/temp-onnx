functionality related to comparing latency and performance data in the ONNX Runtime project. The "compare_latency.py" script compares latency data for different execution providers (EPs) and identifies models with higher latency. The "new_failures.py" script compares performance data between previous and current versions of a software project and identifies differences. These scripts interact with other parts of the project by using the ONNX Runtime library and the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. They may be used as part of a larger performance analysis or testing framework and may interact with other scripts or tools to analyze and visualize the performance data.
