the functionality of running a memory test for the ONNX Runtime project using Docker. It includes a shell script that sets up the necessary variables and runs a Docker container with the specified image. It also includes a shell script that runs the memory test within the Docker container, sets environment variables, builds the project, and executes the memory test application. Additionally, there is a CMake file for building the "onnx_memtest" executable and a main.cpp file that defines functions and methods for running a performance test using the ONNX Runtime with TensorRT execution provider. The code in this directory interacts with other functional areas of the system by using the specified ORT binary path and source directory to build and run the ONNX Runtime code, downloading an ONNX model for the memory test, and printing information about the input nodes of the ONNX model.
