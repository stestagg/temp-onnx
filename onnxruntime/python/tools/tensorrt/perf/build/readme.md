is responsible for building Docker images with TensorRT for the ONNX Runtime project. It provides functions to build the Docker image using different versions of TensorRT, either from a public repository or from a tar.gz package containing binaries. It also builds and installs the latest version of ONNX Runtime (ORT) with TensorRT support. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using common build arguments, running shell commands, and checking the validity of TensorRT versions. It fetches the ORT master repository, checks out a specific branch, and pulls the latest changes. It then builds the ORT library with TensorRT integration using the provided TensorRT and CUDA home directories. The resulting ORT wheel file is installed and can be optionally archived. The code also downloads and extracts the required version of CMake.
