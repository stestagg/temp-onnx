the functionality of downloading and setting up multiple models for performance testing with TensorRT in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes a script for downloading and unzipping files from given URLs, as well as a Python script for setting up the ONNX Zoo models. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by downloading the models, extracting necessary files, creating model folders, and generating a JSON file containing information about the models. This JSON file is used by other components of the project for further processing and testing.
