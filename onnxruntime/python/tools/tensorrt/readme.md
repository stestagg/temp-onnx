contains code and scripts for benchmarking the ONNX Runtime (ORT) engine. It includes files for running inference using the ORT engine, setting up benchmarking processes, analyzing performance metrics, and uploading benchmarking data to a database. The directory also includes scripts for running benchmarking processes in Docker containers and on machines. Additionally, there are subdirectories for memory testing, model file setup, building and packaging components, and comparing latency values between different versions of the project. Overall, the "perf" directory focuses on performance testing and analysis of the project.
