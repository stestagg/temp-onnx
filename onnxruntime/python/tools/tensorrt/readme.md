covers the functionality of performance benchmarking and validation for ONNX models using ONNX Runtime and TensorRT. It includes scripts for running benchmarks, processing performance data, and running benchmarks using Docker. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using the ONNX Runtime Python package, importing utility functions from other modules, downloading additional files, and generating result files. It also relies on metadata files for tracking failed models and session information, and interacts with Docker images and volumes for accessing necessary files and directories.
