contains the implementation of a kernel explorer module in C++ for a larger project. This module provides functionality for exploring and manipulating device arrays. It includes operations such as matrix multiplication, fast gelu activation, softmax calculations, group normalization, skip layer normalization, and vector addition. The code supports different strategies, optimizations, and configurations for these operations, accommodating various data types and matrix layouts. Additionally, the directory includes registration macros and functions for enabling the usage of these implementations in the project.
