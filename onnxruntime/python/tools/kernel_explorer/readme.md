covers the functionality of kernel exploration in the ONNX Runtime project. It allows for the analysis and exploration of kernel operations used in executing machine learning models. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, defining classes and functions used in other components, and registering the module with the ONNX Runtime framework. It also provides functions for updating device arrays and checking the availability of certain features.
