contains code for implementing various operations and functionalities related to the ROCm platform in the project. It includes implementations for matrix multiplication, fast gelu activation, softmax calculations, group normalization, and skip layer normalization. The code provides different strategies, optimizations, and configurations for these operations, supporting different data types and matrix layouts. The directory also includes registration macros and functions for registering the implementations with the kernel explorer and enabling their usage in the project.
