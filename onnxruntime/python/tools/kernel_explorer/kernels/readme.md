covers various areas of functionality related to kernel exploration and optimization in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for operations such as GEMM, softmax, Group Normalization, fast_gelu, and matrix multiplication. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers and dependencies, utilizing libraries such as rocBLAS and ROCm common utilities, and using classes and functions from other modules within the project. It also provides Python bindings through pybind11 to integrate with the rest of the project and expose the functionality to Python code.
