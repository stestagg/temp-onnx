contains Python files that implement various quantization operators for different operations in a neural network model. These operators are used to quantize and optimize the model by performing quantization on specific nodes or operations. The files in this directory define classes that handle the quantization process for operations such as activation functions, convolution, matrix multiplication, pooling, and more. These classes provide methods to quantize the input and output tensors, create new nodes for the quantized operations, and update the ONNX graph accordingly. The directory plays a crucial role in the overall quantization process of the project by providing the necessary functionality to quantize different operations in a neural network model.
