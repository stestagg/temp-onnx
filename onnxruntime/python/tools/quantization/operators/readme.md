covers the quantization of various operators in the ONNX Runtime project, including pooling, softmax, convolution, binary operations, gather, resize, argmax, instance normalization, gemm, global average pooling, split, attention, concat, pad, embed layer normalization, activation, maxpool, and LSTM. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using modules and classes from the ONNX Runtime project, such as the "onnx" module, the "quant_utils" module, and the "base_operator" module. It also interacts with the quantizer object and its methods to perform quantization operations, update the quantized value map, and add new nodes to the list of new nodes in the quantizer. Additionally, the code may import and use utility functions and classes from related modules within the quantization operators directory.
