covers the functionality related to working with the TrtTable data structure and the KeyValue class. It provides methods for initializing, accessing, and manipulating key-value pairs within a table. The TrtTable.py file interacts with the KeyValue class from the CalTableFlatBuffers module. This code is likely used in conjunction with other files in the ONNX Runtime project to handle key-value data structures, possibly for the purpose of quantization.
