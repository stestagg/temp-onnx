contains files related to the quantization process in the project. It includes the "KeyValue" class, which represents a key-value pair and provides methods for initializing, retrieving the key and value, and managing the object. The directory also includes the "TrtTable" class, which is used to read and manipulate data stored in a FlatBuffers format. The "TrtTable" class provides methods for initializing the table, retrieving dictionaries, and checking the length and existence of dictionaries. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in handling quantization-related data and operations within the project.
