covers the functionality for quantizing ONNX models using different quantization methods. It includes classes and functions for static and dynamic quantization configurations, calibration data reading, quantization approaches (ONNX and QDQ), quantization formats, and different quantization modes and data types. The code also performs shape inference and model optimization, provides utilities for debugging quantization-induced accuracy drop, and includes functionality for calibrating ONNX models using various methods. The code interacts with other parts of the system by importing modules and functions, using classes and functions from other modules, and relying on utility functions and classes from related modules.
