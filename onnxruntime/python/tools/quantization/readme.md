contains various modules and classes related to the calibration and quantization of ONNX models. It provides functionality for calibrating and quantizing data, as well as writing calibration tables. The directory includes code for calibrating models using different methods such as MinMax, Entropy, and Percentile. It also contains classes for manipulating and analyzing ONNX models, as well as implementing the quantization process. Additionally, the directory includes scripts for model optimization and shape inference, as well as utility functions for running and debugging ONNX models. The directory also contains subdirectories for handling quantization-related data and implementing quantization operators for different operations in a neural network model. Overall, the "quantization" directory plays a crucial role in the project by providing the necessary functionality for calibrating, quantizing, and optimizing ONNX models.
