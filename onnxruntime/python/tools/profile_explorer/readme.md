contains a Python script that analyzes performance traces generated by the onnxruntime bench tool. It provides various analysis options, such as shape-sensitive and dimension-sensitive analysis of kernel execution times. It can filter and list the top N kernel times for both CPU and GPU, and also has the capability to dump op-kernel correlation information. The script uses pandas for data manipulation and argparse for command-line argument parsing.
