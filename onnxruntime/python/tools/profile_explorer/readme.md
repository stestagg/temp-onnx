covers the functionality of a profiling tool for the ONNX Runtime project. It allows for the analysis and exploration of performance traces in JSON format. The tool can perform shape-sensitive and dimension-sensitive analysis of kernel execution times, supports filtering based on identifiers, and can save analyzed data to a CSV file. The code interacts with other parts of the project by utilizing the ONNX Runtime library and its profiling capabilities.
