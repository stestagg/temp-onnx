covers the functionality of creating an ONNX model with a single custom operator node that wraps an opaque model blob. It interacts with the ONNX library to create the model and define the custom operator node. The code also interacts with the command line to parse input arguments for specifying the domain, custom operator name, input and output information, and attribute data. This code interacts with the external runtime that executes the custom operator.
