contains a script called "create_custom_op_wrapper.py" that is responsible for creating an ONNX model with a single custom operator node. This custom operator wraps an opaque model blob, which is serialized into the custom operator's attributes. The script takes input arguments for the custom operator's name, domain, inputs, outputs, attribute data, opset version, and output model name. It parses these input arguments, creates the custom operator node, and saves the output model in ONNX format.
