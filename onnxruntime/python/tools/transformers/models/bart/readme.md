contains code for exporting and converting models, as well as running inference using ONNX models. It includes functionality for creating directories, setting the device for beam search operations, and handling user input arguments. The code also includes utility functions for initializing and processing data, categorizing and reordering past key values, and getting input and output names for the model wrapper. Additionally, it contains code for exporting the BART encoder and decoder models to ONNX format, as well as code for running inference with both PyTorch and ONNX models.
