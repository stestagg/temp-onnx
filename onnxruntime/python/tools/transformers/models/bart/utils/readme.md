covers the functionality of running inference with BART models, exporting BART models for summarization tasks, and providing utility functions for exporting BART models in ONNX format. It interacts with other parts of the system by utilizing helper functions, classes, and modules from the "utils" module, the "export_helper" module, the "transformers" package, and the ONNX Runtime library. It also relies on the "BartConfig" class and the "ModelOutput" class from the "file_utils" module.
