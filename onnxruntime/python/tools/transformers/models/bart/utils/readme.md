contains utility code for the BART model in the project. It includes code for combining the encoder, decoder, and beam search operations to convert the model to ONNX format. It also includes functions for initializing and processing data, categorizing and reordering past key values, and getting input and output names for the model wrapper. Additionally, it contains code for exporting the BART encoder and decoder models to ONNX format, as well as code for running inference with both PyTorch and ONNX models.
