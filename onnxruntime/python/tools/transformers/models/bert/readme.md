contains code related to the BERT model in the project. It includes a script, eval_squad.py, which evaluates the accuracy of ONNX models for a question-answering task on the SQuAD dataset. The script supports loading pretrained models or custom ONNX models, tokenizing input data, and performing question-answering inference. It generates detailed results and summary metrics in CSV files. Additionally, the directory supports customization of sequence lengths, batch sizes, and execution providers for the models.
