the functionality of measuring the inference latency, top 1 match rate, and ONNX model size for different configurations in mixed precision conversion for the GPT-2 model. It also includes benchmarking the GPT-2 model with past state and converting GPT2 models to ONNX format. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by importing modules and functions from related files, such as `convert_to_onnx.py`, `gpt2_helper.py`, `onnx_model.py`, `benchmark_helper.py`, and `quantize_helper.py`. It also uses predefined constants and variables from these files.
