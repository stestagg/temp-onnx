contains code related to the LongformerAttention model in the project. It includes a dummy PyTorch custom operator for the LongformerAttention, which takes input tensors and returns an output tensor with the same shape. The actual computation inside the operator is not implemented, and the output tensor is initialized with ones. Additionally, the directory includes a setup file, "setup.py", which configures the build for a C++ extension module called "longformer_attention". This file includes dependencies and specifies the source file and compile arguments for the module.
