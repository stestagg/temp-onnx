the functionality related to the Longformer model in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes helper functions for creating dummy inputs, converting inputs to different formats, and getting output shapes for the Longformer model. It also provides a script to convert a Longformer model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to ONNX format. Additionally, there are files for generating test data for evaluating the inference latency of the Longformer model and benchmarking the latency or peak memory usage of the model in the ONNX Runtime project. The code interacts with other parts of the system by importing necessary modules and using them to perform the required operations. It also interacts with the LongformerModel and LongformerSelfAttention classes from the Transformers library, as well as custom ONNX and Torch helper functions.
