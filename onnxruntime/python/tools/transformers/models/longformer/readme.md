contains code and scripts related to the Longformer model in the project. It includes a benchmarking script for measuring latency and memory usage of the Longformer model using PyTorch or ONNX Runtime. There is also a script for converting the Longformer model to ONNX format, with options for exporting padding logic and optimizing the model. Another script generates test data for evaluating inference latency. Additionally, there is code for creating dummy inputs for the Longformer model. The directory also includes a subdirectory for torch extensions, which contains a custom operator for the LongformerAttention model and a setup file for configuring the build.
