contains code and scripts related to benchmarking and optimizing the performance of stable diffusion models. It includes a file for benchmarking the latency and memory usage of models using different engines (Onnxruntime and Torch) and saving the results in a CSV file. There is also a script for optimizing and converting ONNX models from float to half precision for GPU inference. The script allows for customization of operators, enables runtime optimization using Onnx Runtime, and copies additional directories and files related to the stable diffusion ONNX pipeline.
