covers the functionality of exporting and converting various models (BART, Whisper, T5, GPT-2, Stable Diffusion, Longformer, BERT) to ONNX format for inference tasks. It includes classes, functions, and scripts specific to each model, such as encoder and decoder components, benchmarking, optimization, evaluation, and conversion. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by importing utility functions, modules, and classes from related files, such as benchmark_helper, convert_generation, file_utils, onnx, torch, transformers, and onnxruntime. It also uses helper functions, constants, and variables defined in other modules for processing and manipulating the models.
