the functionality of converting T5 and MT5 models to ONNX format. It includes files for converting models to ONNX, defining the T5 decoder model, providing helper functions for processing past key values, initializing the T5 model, defining the T5 encoder model, and combining the encoder and decoder models. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by importing modules and functions from other files, such as torch, T5Helper, benchmark_helper, transformers, and onnxruntime. It also uses helper functions and constants defined in the t5_helper and past_helper modules.
