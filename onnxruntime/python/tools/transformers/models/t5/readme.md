contains code related to the T5 model in the project. It includes files for exporting T5 and MT5 models to ONNX format, processing past key values for an encoder-decoder model, implementing the T5 decoder model with LM head and past key values, exporting the T5 encoder model to ONNX format, and combining a T5Encoder and a T5DecoderInit to create a T5EncoderDecoderInit model. The directory also includes helper functions for working with T5 models, such as loading and exporting models, optimizing and verifying ONNX models, and converting models to mixed precision.
