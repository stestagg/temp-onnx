covers the functionality related to the Whisper model in the ONNX Runtime Transformers project. It includes classes and functions for the WhisperEncoder, WhisperDecoder, and WhisperEncoderDecoderInit modules. The code also provides helper functions for exporting the model to ONNX format and converting it for inference. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by importing modules and classes from related files, such as benchmark_helper, convert_generation, file_utils, onnx, torch, transformers, and onnxruntime.
