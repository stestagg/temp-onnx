contains code related to the Whisper model in the project. It includes files for exporting and optimizing ONNX models for a speech recognition system, chaining together encoder and decoder models, implementing the decoder and encoder models, and providing helper functions for working with the Whisper model. The directory plays a crucial role in the project's speech recognition functionality, allowing for model conversion, inference, and verification using ONNX Runtime.
