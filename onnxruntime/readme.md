contains code and functionality related to the ONNX Runtime project. It includes subdirectories for implementing the Python API and integration, the WebAssembly (WASM) implementation, CUDA, ROCm, and CPU optimizations, core mathematical operations and session management, and event tracing for Windows (ETW). These subdirectories play crucial roles in providing functionality for working with ONNX models, running inference, optimizing computations on GPUs and CPUs, managing sessions, and enabling event tracing and performance analysis in the project.
