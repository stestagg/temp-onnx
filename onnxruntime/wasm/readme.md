contains the implementation of the ONNX runtime for WebAssembly (WASM). It includes files for initializing and managing the ONNX runtime environment, creating and configuring ONNX sessions, manipulating tensors, and running inference. The "api.cc" file implements functions for these tasks, while the "js_internal_api.js" file initializes the JSEP module. This directory is responsible for enabling the ONNX runtime to run on web browsers using WebAssembly technology.
