covers the functionality related to the JavaScript Execution Provider (JSEP) for the ONNX Runtime project. It includes the initialization of the JSEP, setting functions and variables for backend, memory management, copy operations, kernel creation and release, and the run function. This code allows the JSEP to interact with other parts of the project, such as the backend implementation, memory management, and kernel execution. The code in this directory is an integral part of the ONNX Runtime project and is used by other files and components to provide the JSEP functionality.
