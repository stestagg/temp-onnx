the implementation of batched gemm, softmax, gemm, and permute operations for the BERT model on the ROCm platform. It includes both biased and unbiased versions of the operations, implemented using half-precision floating-point (fp16) data type. The code interacts with other parts of the system by including necessary headers, using functions and classes defined in those headers, and utilizing device operation instances. It also relies on specialized classes and operations from the ck::tensor_operation namespace to perform computations efficiently on GPU devices.
