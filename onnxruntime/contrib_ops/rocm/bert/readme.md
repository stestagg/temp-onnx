covers the functionality related to the BERT model in ONNX Runtime using CUDA on the ROCm platform. It includes implementations of attention mechanism, matrix multiplication, fast gelu activation, skip layer normalization, layer normalization, and batched gemm, softmax, and permutation operations. The code interacts with other parts of the system by using common data types, operations, and libraries, such as the ROCm common library, ROCm tunable library, CK (Composable Kernel) library, and ONNX Runtime framework. It also includes interactions with other BERT-related files in the project for data processing, computation, and optimization.
