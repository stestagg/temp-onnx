contains the implementation of group normalization and convolution operations for the ROCm execution provider in the ONNX Runtime. It includes code for computing group normalization using ROCm-specific functions and kernels, as well as functions for applying convolution operations. The directory also includes an implementation of device normalization for group normalization operations, with different instances for different data types and configurations. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in providing normalization and convolution functionality for deep learning models in the project.
