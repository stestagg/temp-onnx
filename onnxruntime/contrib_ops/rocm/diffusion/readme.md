covers the functionality of Group Normalization and NHWC convolution operations for the ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platform in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes CUDA kernels, ROCM kernels, and operator implementations for Group Normalization and NHWC convolution. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, dependencies, and libraries, and it utilizes common utility functions, data structures, and namespaces defined in other files. It also relies on the Composable Kernel framework, the TensorRT library, and the ROCm execution provider in ONNX Runtime.
