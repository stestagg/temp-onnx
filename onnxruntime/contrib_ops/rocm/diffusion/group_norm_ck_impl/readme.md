contains the implementation of device normalization for group normalization operations in a specific project. It includes different instances of device normalization for different data types and configurations. The directory provides code for generating instances of device normalization, templates for different normalization types, and functions to retrieve instances based on input data types, configurations, activation functions, and tensor sizes.
