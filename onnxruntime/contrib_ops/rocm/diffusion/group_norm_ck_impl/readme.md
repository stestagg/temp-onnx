covers the functionality of group normalization in the ONNX Runtime project for the ROCm (AMD GPU) backend. It provides implementations for different configurations of data types, element-wise operations, and thread block sizes. The code interacts with other parts of the project, such as the ck namespace for tensor operations and the ck::tensor_operation::gpu::device namespace for device-specific implementations. It includes necessary header files, calls functions from the ck::tensor_operation namespace, and relies on the "impl.cuh" file for additional implementation details. It also uses the "add_device_operation_instance.hpp" and "device_normalization_impl.hpp" files from the "ck" library.
