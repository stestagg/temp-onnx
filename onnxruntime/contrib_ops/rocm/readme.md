in the ONNX Runtime project plays a crucial role in providing optimized implementations for GPU acceleration on AMD Radeon GPUs. It includes the implementation of a fused convolution operator for the ROCm execution provider, which performs convolution, bias addition, and activation functions in a single step for improved performance. The directory also contains the registration of ROCm contributed kernels, covering a wide range of operations such as gelu, transpose, matmul, convolution, attention, and layer normalization. Additionally, it includes the implementation of various operations and components specific to the BERT model, optimized for ROCm hardware. These operations include attention, fastGelu, gemmFastGelu, layerNorm, multiHeadAttention, skipLayerNorm, and transformerOptions. The directory also provides functionality for group normalization and convolution operations, including code for computing group normalization using ROCm-specific functions and kernels, as well as functions for applying convolution operations. Overall, the "rocm" directory is essential for GPU acceleration and optimized functionality in the ONNX Runtime project on ROCm hardware.
