covers the implementation of various activation functions for the CUDA execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes activation functions such as Affine, ParametricSoftplus, ScaledTanh, Gelu, QuickGelu, and ThresholdedRelu. The code defines activation kernels, registers them with the ONNX operator registry, and provides the implementation for computing the activation functions on GPU using CUDA. It interacts with other parts of the project through the inclusion of necessary headers and the usage of classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime framework.
