contains the implementation of various activation functions for the CUDA execution provider in the ONNX Runtime framework. It includes functions for Affine, ParametricSoftplus, ScaledTanh, Gelu, QuickGelu, and ThresholdedRelu activations. The code registers these activation functions as typed kernels and defines the computation logic for each activation function. This directory provides the necessary functionality for performing activation operations on CUDA devices in the project.
