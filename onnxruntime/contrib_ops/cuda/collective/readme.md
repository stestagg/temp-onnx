covers the implementation of NCCL kernels for collective operations such as all-reduce and all-gather on CUDA devices. It includes helper functions, a NcclContext class for initializing the NCCL communicator, and derived classes AllReduce and AllGather for performing specific operations using NCCL. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using OpKernelInfo and OpKernelContext classes to access tensors, and by using the CUDAExecutionProvider class for GPU operations. It also interacts with the MPI library to initialize and finalize MPI and create the NCCL communicator.
