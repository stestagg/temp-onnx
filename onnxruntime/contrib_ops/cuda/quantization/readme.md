covers the functionality of quantization operations for CUDA devices in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for dequantizing linearly quantized attention values with bias, performing attention calculations with quantized inputs and weights, and quantizing and dequantizing tensors. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, using functions and types from the ONNX Runtime CUDA and common libraries, and registering typed kernels for different data types. It also interacts with CUDA files and utilities provided by the ONNX Runtime project, as well as the CUDA runtime API, cuBLAS library, and other CUDA-specific utilities for GPU operations.
