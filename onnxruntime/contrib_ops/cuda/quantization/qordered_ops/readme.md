covers the functionality of quantization operations for CUDA devices in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes operators for performing quantized Longformer attention, matrix multiplication, unary operations, attention, layer normalization, and quantization/dequantization. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary header files, using functions and data structures defined in those files, and registering operators with the ONNX Runtime framework. It also interacts with the CUDA runtime API, cuBLAS library, and other CUDA-specific utilities for GPU operations.
