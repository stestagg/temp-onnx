contains CUDA implementations of various operations for the CUDA execution provider in the project. These operations include BiasAdd, BiasSplitGelu, and GroupNorm. The implementations involve CUDA kernel code that performs mathematical computations on input tensors and produces output tensors. The directory also includes helper functions and optimizations for performance. These operations are essential for tasks such as adding bias to tensors, splitting tensors and applying activation functions, and normalizing activations in neural network layers.
