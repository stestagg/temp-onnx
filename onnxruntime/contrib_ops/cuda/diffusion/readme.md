covers the functionality of Group Normalization, NHWC convolution, BiasSplitGelu, and BiasAdd operations for the CUDA execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime CUDA provider, including CudaKernel and LaunchGroupNormKernel, to perform the Group Normalization operation on CUDA devices. It also includes necessary headers and uses functions and types from the ONNX Runtime library and CUDA-specific functions and types to perform GPU computations. Additionally, it interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, using namespaces, and using common CUDA functions and types defined in the project for the NHWC convolution and BiasAdd operations.
