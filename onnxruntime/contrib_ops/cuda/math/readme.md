in the ONNX Runtime project contains the CUDA implementations for various mathematical operations used in neural network models. It includes operators for bias and dropout, softmax with bias, binary elementwise operations, bitmask dropout, complex number multiplication, fast Fourier transform (FFT), matrix multiplication, and checking for finiteness of tensors. These CUDA implementations leverage GPU acceleration for efficient computation on NVIDIA GPUs. The directory provides optimized computations for different data types and includes specialized implementations for specific operations.
