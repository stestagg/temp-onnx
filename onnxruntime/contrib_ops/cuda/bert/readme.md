covers various areas of functionality for the BERT model in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations of the Longformer attention mechanism, transpose operations, packed attention operations, layer normalization, skip layer normalization, softmax operations, padding restoration, decoder attention, embedding and layer normalization, multi-head attention, fast Gelu activation, attention concatenation, relative attention bias computation, remove padding, and other operations specific to the BERT model. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, using functions and classes from other files, and utilizing CUDA libraries and utilities. It also registers kernels, accesses input and output tensors, performs computations using CUDA, and handles input validation and shape checks. The code interacts with CUDA libraries, such as cublas_v2.h and cub.cuh, and uses functions and structures from other CUDA files related to the BERT model and transformers. Additionally, it uses namespaces and macros from the ONNX Runtime project and interacts with the CUDA execution provider and OpKernelContext.
