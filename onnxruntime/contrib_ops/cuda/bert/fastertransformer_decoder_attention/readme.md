covers the implementation of the masked multi-head attention operation for the decoder in a BERT model using CUDA. It includes separate files for different head sizes (128, 32, and 64) and provides CUDA kernels for efficient computation. The code interacts with other parts of the system through the inclusion of header files and utility functions specific to the masked multi-head attention operation. The result of the attention operation is used by other components of the BERT model for further processing.
