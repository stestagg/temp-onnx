contains CUDA kernel implementations for performing masked multihead attention in a decoder module. These implementations are optimized for different input sizes and data types, and include functions for launching the kernels with different configurations based on the sequence length. The code is based on an open-source project and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. The implementations also include modifications to the original code, such as removing unsupported features and applying mask filter values.
