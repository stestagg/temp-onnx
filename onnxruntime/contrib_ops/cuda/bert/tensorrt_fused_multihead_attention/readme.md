covers the functionality of implementing CUDA kernels for the fused multihead attention operation in the BERT model. It is specifically optimized for TensorRT and targets different NVIDIA GPU architectures. The code performs computations for the attention mechanism using half-precision floating-point arithmetic (fp16) and interacts with other components of the ONNX Runtime project to enable efficient execution of BERT models on GPUs. It provides an optimized implementation of the attention operation and is likely included or linked with other files and components of the project to build the final executable or library for running BERT models with TensorRT acceleration. The code in this directory interacts with other functional areas of the system, such as the CUDA runtime, TensorRT, and the BERT model implementation, to provide efficient execution of the fused multihead attention operation on NVIDIA GPUs.
