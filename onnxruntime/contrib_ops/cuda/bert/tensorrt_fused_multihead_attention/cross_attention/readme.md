Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality of implementing CUDA kernels for the fused multihead attention operation in the BERT model. It is specifically optimized for TensorRT and targets different NVIDIA GPU architectures. The code performs cross-attention computations using half-precision floating-point arithmetic (fp16) and interacts with other components of the ONNX Runtime project to enable efficient execution of BERT models on GPUs. It provides an optimized implementation of the attention operation and is likely included or linked with other files and components of the project to build the final executable or library for running BERT models with TensorRT acceleration.
