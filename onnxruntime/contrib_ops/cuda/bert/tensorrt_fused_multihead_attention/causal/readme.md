contains compiled code files for CUDA kernel functions that perform specific computations related to the project's system architecture. These files contribute to the functionality of the larger project and are optimized for performance on NVIDIA GPUs. The code in these files is responsible for implementing specific functionalities such as matrix operations and matrix multiplication using half-precision floating-point numbers. The directory "causal" plays a crucial role in enabling high-performance computations within the project.
