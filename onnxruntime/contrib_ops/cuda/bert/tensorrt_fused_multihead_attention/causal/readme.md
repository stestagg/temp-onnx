covers the implementation of CUDA kernels for the fused multihead attention operation in a BERT model. These kernels are optimized for TensorRT and are specifically designed for different NVIDIA GPU architectures. The code interacts with other parts of the ONNX Runtime project, such as the TensorRT engine and the CUDA runtime, to enable efficient execution of the fused multihead attention operation on NVIDIA GPUs.
