the functionality of memory-efficient attention operations for the BERT model on NVIDIA GPUs with different compute capabilities (SM50, SM70, SM75). It includes implementations of functions such as "run_memory_efficient_attention_sm50", "run_memory_efficient_attention_sm70", and "run_memory_efficient_attention_sm75" that dispatch the appropriate block size based on the input data type and target GPU architecture. The code interacts with other parts of the system by utilizing the MemoryEfficientAttentionParams struct and the DispatchBlockSize function defined in the fmha_launch_template.h file.
