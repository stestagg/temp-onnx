contains the CUDA implementation of various operations for the ONNX Runtime project. These operations include Crop, DynamicSlice, ImageScaler, ShrunkenGather, and Trilu. Each operation has its own file that defines the implementation for the CUDA execution provider. These files contain functions and classes that perform specific computations on input tensors and produce output tensors. The CUDA implementation allows for efficient parallel processing on GPUs. Overall, the "tensor" directory plays a crucial role in providing GPU-accelerated functionality for tensor operations in the ONNX Runtime project.
