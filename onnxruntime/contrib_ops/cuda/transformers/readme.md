contains CUDA implementations of various operators and kernels for text generation tasks in the project. It includes files for beam search, greedy search, and sampling operations. These files provide functions for performing computations on GPU, such as finding top-k values, processing logits, updating attention cache, and expanding buffers. The code also includes console dumpers for debugging purposes and helper functions for initializing the state of the search algorithms. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient text generation using CUDA in the project.
