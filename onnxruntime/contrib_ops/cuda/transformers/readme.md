covers functionality related to transformers in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations of algorithms such as beam search and greedy search, as well as helper functions for generation tasks on CUDA devices. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, using functions and data structures defined in those headers, and utilizing CUDA-specific device helpers and libraries. It also interacts with files in the core/providers/cuda and contrib_ops/cuda/transformers directories, as well as with other components of the ONNX Runtime project, such as the CUDA execution provider.
