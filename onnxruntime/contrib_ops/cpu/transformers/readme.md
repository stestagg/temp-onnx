covers various areas of functionality related to transformer models in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for different subgraphs, such as the Whisper Decoder, Whisper Encoder, T5 Encoder, T5 Decoder, and GPT subgraphs. It also includes code for performing beam search and greedy search operations, as well as handling sampling parameters and logits processing. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, using classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime framework, and interacting with other components such as the session state, tensor operations, and subgraph execution.
