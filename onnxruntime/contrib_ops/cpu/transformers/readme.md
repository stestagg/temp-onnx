contains the implementation of various classes and subgraphs related to performing beam search, greedy search, and sampling operations in transformer-based models. It includes classes for beam search, greedy search, and sampling algorithms, as well as classes for handling parameters, scoring, and processing logits. The directory also includes subgraphs for specific models such as GPT-2, T5, and Whisper, which perform encoding, decoding, and attention operations. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling sequence generation and language processing tasks in the project.
