contains the implementation of the ATen operator for the project. It includes the Compute function that handles the conversion of input tensors to DLManagedTensors, executes the ATen operation using the ATenOperatorExecutor, and converts the output DLManagedTensors back to OrtValues. Additionally, it provides a function for executing the reduce sum operation using the ATenOperatorExecutor.
