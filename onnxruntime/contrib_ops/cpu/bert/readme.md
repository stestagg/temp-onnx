contains the implementation of various classes and operators related to the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model in the project. It includes classes for computing attention mechanisms, applying the Gelu activation function, detecting bifurcations, performing embedding layer normalization, and multi-head attention computations. The implementation also includes helper functions for checking input validity and parallelization using a thread pool. These components are crucial for the natural language processing tasks and operations performed by the BERT model in the project.
