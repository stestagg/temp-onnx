in the onnxruntime/contrib_ops directory contains the implementation of various CPU-specific operations and kernels for the ONNX Runtime project. It includes files for activation functions, convolution operations, cropping and resizing, dynamic slicing, element-wise operations, expanding dimensions, fused operations (convolution, GEMM, matmul), grid sampling, image scaling, inverse computation, layer normalization, max pooling with mask, mean variance normalization, MurmurHash3 algorithm, NCHWc format operations, sample operation, skip layer normalization, tokenizer, unique operation, word convolutional embedding, and more. Additionally, it includes subdirectories for attention mechanisms and LSTM operations, ATen operator implementation, quantization-related operations, BERT model components, math operations, transformer-based models, and tensor operations. These files and subdirectories collectively contribute to the functionality and performance of the ONNX Runtime project on CPU platforms.
