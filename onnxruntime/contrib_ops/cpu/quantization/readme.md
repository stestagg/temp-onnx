contains the implementation of various custom operator kernels and classes for performing quantization-related operations in the project. These operations include attention calculations, LSTM computations, matrix multiplication, max pooling, embedding layer normalization, linear activations, binary operations, concatenation, global average pooling, lookup table transformations, average pooling, softmax computation, element-wise selection, and matrix multiplication. The code in this directory handles the quantization and scaling of input and output tensors, as well as the computation of these operations using optimized algorithms and libraries.
