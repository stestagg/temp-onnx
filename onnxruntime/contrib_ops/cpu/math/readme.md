covers the functionality of performing matrix multiplication between a sparse tensor and a dense tensor. It implements the SparseToDenseMatMul operation for the ONNX Runtime project. The code defines the SparseToDenseMatMul class, which computes the operation by taking in attributes such as alpha, transA, and transB. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary header files and using functions and structures from the ONNX Runtime library. It handles different cases based on the attributes to determine the matrix multiplication algorithm to use and includes a specialization for float data type to handle scaling.
