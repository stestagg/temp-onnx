covers the functionality of the ShrunkenGather operator for the ONNX Runtime project. It implements the operator as a kernel for the CPU execution provider, allowing for gathering elements from an input tensor based on indices provided in another tensor. The code includes a utility function for validating input tensors and dimensions. The ShrunkenGather operator is used in the Compute function to perform the gathering operation. It interacts with other parts of the project through the PrepareForCompute function and the Gather operator.
