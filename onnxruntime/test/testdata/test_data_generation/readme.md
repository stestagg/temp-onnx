contains subdirectories and files responsible for generating test data for different optimizers and schedulers in the machine learning project. It includes scripts for generating test data for the Adam optimizer, LR scheduler optimizer, and SGD optimizer. These scripts define dummy modules and provide functions to generate test data with specified configurations. The generated test data includes parameters, gradients, and optimizer/scheduler state information, which is saved in JSON format for further analysis and testing.
