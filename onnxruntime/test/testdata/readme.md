contains various files and subdirectories that are crucial for testing and generating test data in the project. It includes scripts for creating ONNX models with specific configurations, testing the support for different operations and execution providers, and evaluating the partitioning of nodes based on capabilities. The directory also contains files for generating test data for different optimizers and schedulers, as well as files that define computational graphs for performing various operations and transformations. Additionally, there are subdirectories that focus on specific areas of functionality such as computation reduction, runtime optimization, fusion, and model parallelism. The directory plays a significant role in ensuring the correctness and performance of the project's ONNX-based computational graph framework.
