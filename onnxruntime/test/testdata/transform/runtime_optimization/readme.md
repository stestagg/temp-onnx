contains a file called "add_with_surrounding_identities_gen.py" that defines a graph for performing addition operations on input tensors. The graph includes surrounding identity operations and is saved as an ONNX model file. This directory likely plays a role in optimizing the runtime performance of the project by providing optimized graph generation for addition operations.
