contains a file called "mlm_bert_e2e.py" that defines the structure and operations of a machine learning model for masked language modeling (MLM) using the BERT architecture. The model includes attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) components, with operations such as matrix multiplication, addition, reshaping, and normalization. Additionally, the code creates a graph and saves the model in the ONNX format. This directory is responsible for implementing the MLM functionality of the project.
