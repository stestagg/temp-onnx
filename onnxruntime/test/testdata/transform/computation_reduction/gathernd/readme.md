contains a collection of files that define ONNX models for performing various operations on input tensors. These operations include layer normalization, matrix multiplication, addition, and gathering specific elements based on given indices. Each file represents a different combination of operations and includes the necessary initializers for the model parameters. The resulting models are saved as ONNX files. This directory plays a crucial role in the project by providing functionality for manipulating and transforming input tensors using the ONNX framework.
