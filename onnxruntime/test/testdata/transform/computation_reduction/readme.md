contains subdirectories and files that define models in ONNX format for performing computation reduction operations. These operations include matrix multiplication, gathering, reshaping, attention mechanisms, layer normalization, and addition. The files in this directory play a significant role in the project by providing functionality for creating and saving ONNX models for various computation reduction tasks, as well as implementing masked language modeling (MLM) using the BERT architecture. Additionally, the directory includes functionality for manipulating and transforming input tensors using the ONNX framework.
