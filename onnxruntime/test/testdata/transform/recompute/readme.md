contains a file called "recompute_test_graph_generator.py" that generates test data for the MemoryOptimizer tests in the project. It includes two test cases for different models. The test cases create instances of the models, run them with sample input data, and ensure that the models execute without any exceptions. The generated test data is saved in ONNX format for further testing and analysis.
