contains code and scripts for generating and saving various ONNX models that perform fusion operations. These models are used in the larger system architecture of the project for tasks such as attention operations, bias-dropout fusion, Gelu activation, softmax fusion, constant folding, convolution operations with different activations, matrix multiplication with transposed inputs, GemmSum functionality, layer normalization, quantization and dequantization, reshape fusion, skip layer normalization, and transpose-matmul fusion. These models are designed to optimize and improve the efficiency and performance of the project's natural language processing tasks and deep learning frameworks.
