contains test files that define computational graphs for various models using the ONNX framework. These models include a basic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model and a self-attention model using the BART and Megatron architectures. The code in these files initializes the weights and biases of the models, performs matrix operations, applies activation functions, and saves the resulting models as ONNX files. This directory plays a role in testing and validating the functionality of these models within the larger software project.
