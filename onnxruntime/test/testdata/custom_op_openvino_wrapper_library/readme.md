contains files that register custom operations and implement a custom OpenVINO kernel for the project. These files enable the integration of OpenVINO functionality into the project, allowing for the conversion of ONNX tensor types to OpenVINO types, validation of input and output shapes and types, conversion of ORT tensors to OpenVINO tensors, and performing inference using the OpenVINO model. The directory plays a crucial role in extending the project's capabilities with OpenVINO technology.
