contains tests for the ORT C++ API on the iOS platform. These tests specifically focus on the sigmoid function and utilize the ORT C++ API and the CoreML execution provider. The tests involve loading a model, creating input and expected output tensors, running the model using the ORT session, and comparing the output values with the expected values. Additionally, the directory includes setup and teardown methods for the test class, as well as a method to retrieve the file path of the model.
