contains unit tests for the quantization functionality in the project. These tests verify the accuracy and correctness of the quantization and dequantization of float values to int8 and uint8 values. Additionally, the tests ensure that the creation of quantization parameters from tensors is handled correctly. This directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the quantization feature in the project.
