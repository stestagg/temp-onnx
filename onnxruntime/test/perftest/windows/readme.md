in the onnxruntime/test/perftest directory contains a file called "utils.cc" that provides utility functions and a class for measuring CPU usage and peak working set size in a Windows environment. The file includes functions such as `GetPeakWorkingSetSize` to retrieve the peak working set size of the current process, and a `CPUUsage` class that calculates the CPU usage percentage by comparing system and process times. This directory and file are essential for performance testing and monitoring in the project.
