contains code and tests related to various optimization techniques in the project. It includes functionality for quantization and precision transformation, compute optimization, fusion of operations, common subexpression elimination, graph transformations, graph transformer utilities, initializer functionality, layout transformation, and optimization of convolutional neural network models. The directory also includes tests for runtime optimization. Overall, the "optimizer" directory plays a crucial role in improving the performance and efficiency of the deep learning models in the project.
