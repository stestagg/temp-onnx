contains code for benchmarking various functionalities of the project. It includes benchmarking functions for activation functions, batch normalization, copying data, broadcasting operations, Gelu function, CPU allocator, graph resolution, model loading and session creation, pooling operations, quantization parameters and functions, finding minimum and maximum values, bilinear upsampling, and thread pools. These benchmarks measure the performance of different operations and configurations, such as batch sizes, input sizes, thread counts, and parallelization strategies. The code utilizes libraries like ONNX Runtime, Eigen, MLAS, and Google Benchmark to provide insights into the performance characteristics of the project's functionalities.
