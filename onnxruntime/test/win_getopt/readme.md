contains two subdirectories, "wide" and "mb", which both implement the getopt function for parsing command line arguments in a C program. This functionality allows the program to handle options and their associated arguments passed by the user. The code in these subdirectories reads the command line arguments, checks if they match specified options, and provides error handling for invalid options and missing arguments. This directory plays a crucial role in the project by providing a key component for command line argument parsing and option handling.
