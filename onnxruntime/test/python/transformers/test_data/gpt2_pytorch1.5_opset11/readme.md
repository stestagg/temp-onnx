contains a script called "generate_tiny_gpt2_model.py" that is used to generate a small GPT2 model for testing a fusion script. The script takes an ONNX model as input and resizes its weights and dimensions based on specified parameters. The resized model is then saved as an ONNX file. Additionally, the script generates test data for the resized model by randomly generating input tensors and running inference using the resized model.
