contains files related to the contribution of additional operations to the ONNX Runtime project. It includes unit tests for the ATen embedding operation, a test reference implementation and model for the "torch_embedding" operation, and a test reference implementation and model for the "Trilu" operation. These files validate the functionality of these contributed operations using randomly generated input data and compare the output with expected results. The directory also includes a helper file for generating ONNX models and data to test ONNX Runtime contrib ops. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in testing and validating the functionality of contributed operations in the ONNX Runtime project.
