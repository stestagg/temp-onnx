contains various unit tests and utility functions related to the quantization of ONNX models in the project. It includes tests for quantizing different operations such as convolution, pooling, softmax, and reshape. The tests cover different quantization types and formats, and verify the correctness of the quantized models. Additionally, the directory includes utility functions for generating test data, checking the correctness of models, and manipulating ONNX models. Overall, the "quantization" directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the quantization process in the project.
