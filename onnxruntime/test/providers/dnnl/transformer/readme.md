contains test cases for the fusion of MatMul and Add operations with various post-operations in the ONNX Runtime project. The tests validate the correctness of the fusion and compare the expected output with the actual output. The tests cover different fusion patterns, including non-associative operations and the maximum number of post-ops supported. Additionally, the directory includes tests for fusion with other element-wise operations and functions that take the alpha attribute.
