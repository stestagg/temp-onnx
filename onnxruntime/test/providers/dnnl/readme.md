contains test cases and functionality related to the DNNL execution provider in the project. It includes a test case for the DNNLExecutionProvider class, which verifies the metadata and allocator name. Additionally, it has subdirectories for mathematical operations and transformer fusion tests using the DNNL provider. The mathematical operations tests cover scenarios such as exponentiation and dequantization, while the transformer tests validate the fusion of operations and compare expected and actual outputs. Overall, this directory ensures the correctness and functionality of the DNNL provider in the project.
