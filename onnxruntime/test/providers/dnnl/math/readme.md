contains test cases for mathematical operations using the DNNL execution provider in the project. It includes test cases for the "Pow" operator, which covers scenarios of broadcasting a scalar value to an input tensor and performing element-wise exponentiation. Additionally, it includes test cases for the DequantizeLinear operation, which covers scenarios such as using constant initializers, different data types, and 2D inputs. The tests in this directory ensure the correctness of the implementation for these mathematical operations with the DNNL provider.
