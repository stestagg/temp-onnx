contains test cases for the CUDA provider in the project. These tests cover various scenarios such as CUDA memory allocation, host-device memory copy, deferred memory release, and reduction functions. Additionally, there are tests for the BeamSearchTopK and GreedySearchTopOne functions, which perform top-k and top-1 operations respectively. The directory also includes tests for the CUDA implementation of fill operation and the CudaGemmOptions class, which manages options for the General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) operation. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the correctness and functionality of the CUDA provider in the project.
