contains the necessary files and test cases for the CUDA execution provider in the project. It includes a unit test file that tests all functionality of the CUDA provider. The "test_cases" subdirectory within "cuda" contains various test cases that cover scenarios such as CUDA memory allocation, host-device memory copy, deferred memory release, and reduction functions. It also includes tests for the BeamSearchTopK and GreedySearchTopOne functions, as well as the CUDA implementation of the fill operation and the CudaGemmOptions class for the General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) operation. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the correctness and functionality of the CUDA provider in the project.
