contains unit tests for various neural network operations in the project. It includes tests for operations such as BatchNormalization, Convolution, Dropout, Flatten, InstanceNormalization, LpNormalization, LRN, MaxRoiPool, MaxPool, AveragePool, QLinearConv, Shrink, StringNormalizer, TfIdfVectorizer, and MaxUnpool. The tests cover different scenarios and configurations of these operations, ensuring that they produce the expected output given different inputs and attributes. This directory plays a crucial role in verifying the correctness and functionality of the neural network operations implemented in the project.
