in the onnxruntime project contains test cases and unit tests for various sequence operations. These tests cover scenarios such as stacking and concatenating sequences, handling empty inputs, and working with scalar inputs. The tests ensure the correct behavior of operations like ConcatFromSequence, SequenceLength, SequenceAt, SequenceEmpty, SequenceInsert, SequenceErase, SequenceConstruct, and SplitToSequence. This directory plays a crucial role in testing and validating the functionality of sequence operations in the onnxruntime project.
