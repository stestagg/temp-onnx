contains code for implementing and testing recurrent neural network (RNN) models, specifically GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The code includes implementations of the GRU and LSTM operations, as well as helper functions for printing and executing these operations. The directory also includes unit tests for verifying the correctness of the GRU and LSTM implementations, covering various configurations such as forward, reverse, and bidirectional processing, different activation functions, and weight configurations. The RNN operator is a significant part of the project's neural network functionality.
