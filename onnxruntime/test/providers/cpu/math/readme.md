contains test cases for various mathematical operations in the project. These tests cover a wide range of scenarios and inputs to ensure the correctness and functionality of the operations. The tests include operations such as "Clip", "CumSum", "Det", "Einsum", element-wise operations, "Gemm", "Hardmax", "LogSoftmax", "MatMul", "MatMulInteger", "QLinearMatMul", "Round", "Sign", "Softmax", and "TopK". The tests validate different aspects of these operations, such as input values, dimensions, data types, broadcasting, axis values, and compatibility with different execution providers. The directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the mathematical operations in the project.
