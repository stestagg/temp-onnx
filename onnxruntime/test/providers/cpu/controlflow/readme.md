contains test cases and implementations for control flow operators in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes files for testing the "If" operator, which handles conditional branching, the "Loop" operator, which allows for executing a subgraph in a loop, and the "Scan" operator, which performs operations on sequences. These files cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correct behavior of these control flow operators. The directory plays a crucial role in testing and validating the functionality of control flow operations in the ONNX Runtime.
