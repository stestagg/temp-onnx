contains test files for various operations related to tensor manipulation and transformation in the project. These tests cover a wide range of functionality, including casting data types, col2im operations, compression, concatenation, constant operations, dynamic quantization, expansion, eye-like operations, gathering elements and indices, one-hot encoding, padding, quantization, resizing, reversing sequences, scattering elements and indices, shape operations, size calculations, slicing, space-to-depth and depth-to-space operations, splitting tensors, squeezing dimensions, reshaping, mean-variance normalization, tiling, transposing, triangular matrix operations, unique values, unsqueezing, upsampling, and conditional operations. These tests ensure the correctness and expected behavior of these operations in different scenarios and configurations.
