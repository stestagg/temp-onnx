contains unit tests for the CPUExecutionProvider class, which tests the metadata functionality of the CPUExecutionProvider. It also includes test cases for running ONNX models using different providers, with infrastructure for setting parameters, checking model support, and comparing results. Additionally, the directory includes subdirectories for machine learning operations, object detection, activation functions, control flow operators, generator operators, mathematical operations, neural network operations, optional operations, reduction operations, recurrent neural network (RNN) models, sequence operations, signal processing operations, and tensor manipulation and transformation operations. These subdirectories contain various test cases and unit tests that cover a wide range of functionality and scenarios to ensure the accuracy, correctness, and functionality of the respective components in the project.
