contains code and test cases for testing reduction operations in the project. It includes tests for various reduction operations such as ReduceL1, ArgMax, and ArgMin, covering different scenarios such as reducing along specific axes and handling different data types. The code uses the Google Test framework for testing and includes test cases with expected input and output values. Additionally, there is a Python script that generates test cases using the NumPy library, covering various combinations of axes, keepdims options, and reduction operations.
