contains code for testing various operators and backends related to Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) in the project. It includes test cases for operators such as AveragePool, BatchNorm, Cast, Conv, Gather, InstanceNormalization, LeakyRelu, Logical operators, LRN, MatMul, MaxPool, ReduceOp, Resize, and other QNN-specific operations. The tests cover different scenarios, configurations, and input types to ensure the correctness and consistency of the QNN CPU and High Throughput (HTP) backends. The code also includes utilities for running QNN model tests, checking backend availability, and setting up mock kernels.
