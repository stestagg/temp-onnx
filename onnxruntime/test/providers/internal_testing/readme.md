contains files and test cases related to the Internal Testing Execution Provider in the project. It includes implementations for the Convolution operator, the InternalTestingExecutionProvider class, and the InternalTestingEP custom execution provider. These files provide functionality for executing models using internal testing capabilities, registering static kernels, creating preferred allocators, determining data layout, and generating compute capabilities. The test cases validate the partitioning of nodes in a graph, handling input dependencies, and partitioning models using the NNAPI execution provider. Overall, this directory focuses on the execution and testing of models with specific operators on a custom hardware device.
