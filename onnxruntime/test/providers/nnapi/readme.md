contains tests for the NnapiExecutionProvider, which is responsible for executing ONNX models on Android devices using the Neural Network API (NNAPI). The tests cover various scenarios such as model loading, operator support, quantization and dequantization, and partitioning. The tests verify that the NnapiExecutionProvider correctly handles different types of models and produces the expected outputs.
