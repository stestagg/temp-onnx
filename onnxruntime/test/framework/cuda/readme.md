contains code for testing CUDA fence functionality in the inference session of the ONNX runtime. It includes tests for matrix multiplication and addition operations on GPU and CPU, as well as tests for tiling operations with initializers and computed inputs. The code creates a graph with nodes representing different operations and resolves the graph to ensure correctness. The tests verify the expected outputs of the operations using fake input data.
