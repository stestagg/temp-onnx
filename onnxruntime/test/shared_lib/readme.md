contains files that are related to the shared library functionality of the project. It includes CUDA kernel functions for array operations, custom kernels for a machine learning framework, image inference using a pre-trained model, memory allocation unit tests, C++ API tests, input and output type checks, model loading tests, sparse tensor functionality tests, custom operator tests, run options tests, session options tests, and a utility function for creating default options for the CUDA provider. These files contribute to various aspects of the project, such as GPU computations, model inference, memory management, and testing.
