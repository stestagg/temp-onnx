contains code for benchmarking various operations in the MLAS library, which is a machine learning library. It includes files for benchmarking quantized matrix multiplication (QGEMM), convolution operations, symmetric quantized gemm operations, and matrix multiplication (SGEMM). The code generates random input data and measures the execution time of these operations using the MLAS library and the Google Benchmark library. The benchmarks are performed for different configurations and parameters, such as matrix sizes, thread configurations, and input parameters for convolution operations. The directory also includes a utility file with functions for benchmarking and generating random vectors. Overall, the "bench" directory plays a crucial role in evaluating the performance of key operations in the MLAS library.
