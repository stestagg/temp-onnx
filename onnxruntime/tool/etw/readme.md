contains code related to event tracing for Windows (ETW) in the onnxruntime project. It includes implementations for capturing and processing events in real-time or from an ETL file. The code provides functions for adding event providers and handlers, starting and stopping trace sessions, and checking for lost events and buffers. It also includes code for parsing and processing event records, retrieving metadata and property information, and printing event properties. Additionally, there is code for generating a performance report from an ETL file, calculating statistics such as average time per operation and total time. Overall, the "etw" directory plays a crucial role in enabling event tracing and performance analysis in the onnxruntime project.
