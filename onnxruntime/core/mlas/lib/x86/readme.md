covers the functionality of implementing the kernels for single precision matrix/matrix multiply operation (SGEMM) using SSE2 and AVX instructions. It provides macros to compute blocks of the output matrix by multiplying and accumulating elements from matrix A and matrix B. This code interacts with other parts of the ONNX Runtime project that require SGEMM functionality, ensuring proper functioning of the software.
