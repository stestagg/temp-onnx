contains implementation files for optimized matrix multiplication operations in the project. It includes AVX and SSE2 kernels for single precision matrix/matrix multiplication (SGEMM). These files provide efficient computation using SIMD instructions for different block sizes and number of rows. Additionally, the directory includes a file that implements a routine to load the return address into the ebx register, avoiding external dependencies.
