covers various areas of functionality related to mathematical operations, such as convolution, matrix multiplication, pooling, and transcendental functions, using AVX, AVX2, AVX512F, and SSE2 instructions. It includes implementations for symmetric quantized integer convolution, hyperbolic tangent function, softmax operation, error function, exponential function, and more. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary header files, referencing external symbols and constants, and using common macros and structures defined in other files. It also utilizes registers, memory addresses, and input/output buffers provided by the calling code.
