contains various files that implement kernels and provide common kernel macros and structures for different operations in the project. These operations include matrix/matrix multiplication, convolution, pooling, softmax, hyperbolic tangent, and transcendental functions. The files utilize different instruction sets such as AVX, AVX2, AVX512F, and SSE2 to optimize performance. They handle different data types, padding, bias addition, and post-processing. The directory also includes files for converting between half-precision and single-precision floats. Overall, the files in this directory play a crucial role in optimizing the performance of these operations in the project.
