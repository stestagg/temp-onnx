contains various assembly files that implement optimized kernels for different operations in the project. These operations include symmetric quantized integer convolution, double precision matrix/matrix multiplication, error function computation, logistic function computation, quantized integer matrix/matrix multiplication, quantized integer matrix/vector multiplication, single precision convolution, single precision matrix/matrix multiplication, softmax operation, pooling operation, hyperbolic tangent function computation, and transcendental function computation. The files utilize different instruction sets such as AVX, AVX2, AVX512 core, AVX512 VNNI, AVXVNNI, SSE2, and FMA3 to provide efficient calculations and performance optimizations for these operations.
