contains the implementation of optimized kernels for matrix multiplication operations using ARM NEON instructions in the project. It includes files for both quantized integer matrix/matrix multiply (QGEMM) and single precision matrix/matrix multiply (SGEMM) operations. The code provides functions for multiplying matrices of different sizes, handling zero initialization and accumulation modes for the output matrix, and supports various numbers of columns and rows. These optimized kernels play a crucial role in improving the performance of matrix multiplication operations in the project.
