contains the implementation of kernels for matrix/matrix and matrix/vector multiplication operations in single precision (SGEMM and SGEMV) for the project. These kernels provide functions for performing efficient matrix multiplication on a set of rows, with options for zeroing the output matrix or adding to existing values. The functions handle different cases based on the number of rows and columns in the matrices, optimizing performance and handling special cases. This directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient matrix operations within the project.
