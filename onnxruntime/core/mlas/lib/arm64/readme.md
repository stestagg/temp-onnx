contains assembly code files that implement various kernels for different operations in the project. These operations include symmetric quantized integer convolution, depthwise convolution, matrix/matrix multiplication, and matrix/vector multiplication. The code is optimized for ARM64 architecture and includes functionality for loading input and filter data, performing dot product calculations, and post-processing the results. The kernels support different kernel sizes, input and output channel counts, and output element counts. They also include functionality for scaling, biasing, and quantization. These files play a crucial role in the project by providing optimized routines for efficient computation of these operations on ARM64 architecture.
