in the project contains optimized implementations of routines using AVX512F, AVX, and AVX2 instructions. These routines are used for quantizing buffers, finding minimum and maximum elements in an array, and performing quantized integer depthwise convolution and quantized linear add operations. The code efficiently utilizes SIMD instructions to improve performance and supports different data types and batch processing.
