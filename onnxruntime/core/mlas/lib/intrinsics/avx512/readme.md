contains the implementation of routines to quantize buffers using AVX512F instructions in the project. It provides functions for linear quantization with different output types, such as unsigned 8-bit and signed 8-bit. The quantization formula used follows the specifications in the ONNX operator documentation. The code efficiently utilizes AVX512 intrinsics for performing the quantization.
