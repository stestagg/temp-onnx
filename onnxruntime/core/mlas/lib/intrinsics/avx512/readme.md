the functionality of quantizing buffers using AVX512F instructions. It implements the QuantizeLinear function, which quantizes the input buffer using the provided quantization parameters. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers and utilizing functions and types defined in those headers. It also utilizes AVX512 intrinsics for efficient vectorized operations during quantization.
