contains files that implement optimized functions using AVX2 instructions for the quantized integer depthwise convolution and quantized linear add operations. These functions are designed to improve the performance of the project by utilizing SIMD instructions. The code supports different data types, handles both scalar and non-scalar inputs, and processes data in batches.
