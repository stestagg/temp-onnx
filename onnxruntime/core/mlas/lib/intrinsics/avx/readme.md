contains code that implements the logic to find the minimum and maximum elements in an array using AVX instructions. This code utilizes vectorization to process multiple elements at once, improving performance. It checks if there are at least 8 elements to efficiently process and uses AVX instructions to find the minimum and maximum values. If there are fewer than 8 elements, it falls back to a scalar approach. The final minimum and maximum values are stored in the provided output variables.
