Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality of finding the minimum and maximum elements in an array using AVX instructions. It includes the implementation of the function `MlasReduceMinimumMaximumF32KernelAvx` which takes an input array and its length, and uses AVX instructions to process the array in parallel and find the minimum and maximum values. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary header files and using functions and types defined in those files.
