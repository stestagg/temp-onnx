The code in this directory implements the kernels for the quantized integer matrix/matrix multiply operation (QGEMM) using ARM NEON instructions. It provides an optimized implementation for matrix multiplication using quantized integer data types. The code takes input matrices A and B, performs matrix multiplication, and accumulates the result into matrix C. It also handles scaling and zero point offsets for the quantized data. The code interacts with other parts of the project by providing this optimized implementation for matrix multiplication.
