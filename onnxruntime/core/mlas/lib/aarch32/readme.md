contains the implementation of optimized kernels for the quantized integer matrix/matrix multiply operation (QGEMM) on ARMv7-A architecture. These kernels provide efficient functions for multiplying matrices of quantized integers, with support for different matrix sizes and accumulation modes. The code includes specific optimizations for processing 4, 2, and 1 rows of the matrices, and handles partial columns by either overwriting or accumulating the output matrix.
