contains files that implement various matrix multiplication operations for the POWER10 architecture. It includes kernels for both double precision (DGEMM) and single precision (SGEMM) matrix/matrix multiplication. These kernels utilize vector instructions and optimizations specific to the POWER10 architecture to improve performance. Additionally, the directory includes files for quantizing floating-point values to fixed-point values using linear quantization, with support for both unsigned 8-bit and signed 8-bit values. There is also a file that implements the QGEMM kernel specifically for the POWER10 architecture, supporting quantized matrix multiplication with 8-bit integer inputs and outputs. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in providing optimized matrix multiplication and quantization functionality for the project on the POWER10 architecture.
