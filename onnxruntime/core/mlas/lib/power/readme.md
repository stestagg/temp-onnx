covers functionality related to matrix/matrix multiplication and quantization using the POWER10 architecture. It includes implementations for both single and double precision matrix/matrix multiplication (SGEMM and DGEMM) as well as quantization functions. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers and using functions and data structures defined in those headers. It also utilizes the MLASI library for additional functions and types.
