contains assembly code files that implement various inner kernels for performing convolution and matrix multiplication operations on symmetrically quantized integer values. These kernels are optimized for ARM architecture and use NEON instructions for efficient computation. The code handles different input and output channel counts, kernel sizes, and post-processing steps such as bias addition, scaling, and quantization. It supports both u8s8 and s8s8 data types, and includes functions for depthwise convolution operations. The directory also includes kernels for half precision matrix/matrix multiply (HALF GEMM) and quantized integer matrix/matrix multiply (QGEMM) operations. These kernels handle different sizes of matrices and apply zero point offsets and accumulation to the output matrix. Overall, the directory plays a crucial role in implementing high-performance computation operations for the project.
