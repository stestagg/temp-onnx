in the project contains the implementation of the single precision matrix/matrix multiply operation (SGEMM) kernels. It provides functions for performing efficient matrix multiplication on a set of rows, with options for zeroing the output matrix or adding to the existing values. The code in this directory utilizes vector instructions for optimized computation.
