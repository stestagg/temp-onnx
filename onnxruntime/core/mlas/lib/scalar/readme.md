contains the implementation of various scalar kernels for mathematical operations in the project. It includes files for single precision direct convolution, matrix/matrix multiplication, and matrix/vector multiplication. These kernels handle different parameters such as padding, strides, dilations, and zero mode options to perform the necessary calculations. The code in this directory plays a crucial role in performing mathematical operations efficiently and accurately within the project.
