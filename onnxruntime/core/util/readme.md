contains code related to mathematical functions and operations, as well as thread management and affinity settings in the project. It provides implementations of various mathematical functions using Eigen, a C++ template library for linear algebra. These functions are optimized for CPU execution and are used for efficient numerical computations in the project. Additionally, the directory includes code for creating and configuring thread pools, setting the number of threads for intra and inter-op operations, controlling spinning behavior, and handling custom thread creation and joining. It also includes functions for setting thread affinity, although this feature may not be available in all builds of the project.
