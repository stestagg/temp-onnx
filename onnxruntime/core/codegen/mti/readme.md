in the onnxruntime project contains code for TVM code generation. It includes utility functions and operations for manipulating shapes, performing arithmetic operations, creating tensors, and handling TVM modules. The "tensor" subdirectory implements various tensor operations such as casting, concatenation, cropping, expansion, gathering, padding, reshaping, slicing, splitting, tiling, transposing, and selection. The "nn" subdirectory focuses on convolution operations, LSTM computations, and pooling operations. It includes functions for convolution, padding, reshaping, transpose operations, and different strategies for convolution. The "math" subdirectory provides functions for mathematical operations on tensors, including binary operations, matrix multiplication, reduction operations, softmax, log softmax, and unary operations. The "debug" subdirectory contains a file for printing the values of a TVM tensor, supporting different data types and utilizing the TVM framework. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in the project by providing essential functionality for TVM code generation and tensor manipulation.
