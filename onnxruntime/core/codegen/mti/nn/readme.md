contains code for performing convolution operations, LSTM computations, and pooling operations in the project. It includes functions for 1D and 2D convolution, padding, reshaping, transpose operations, and different strategies for convolution. The code also implements the LSTM_cell function, which performs computations for a single LSTM cell using matrix multiplication, element-wise addition, activation functions, and peephole connections. Additionally, the directory includes code for various pooling operations, such as max pooling and average pooling, as well as global max pooling and global average pooling. The functions in this directory support specific layouts and take input tensors, pool attributes, output shape, and a name as parameters.
