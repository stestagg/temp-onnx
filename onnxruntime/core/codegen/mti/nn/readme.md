covers the functionality of pooling operations (MaxPool, AveragePool, GlobalMaxPool, GlobalAveragePool) and convolution operations (Conv1D, Conv2D) for the ONNX Runtime project. It also includes the implementation of the LSTM_cell function for LSTM cell computation. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using functions and utilities from the "core/codegen/mti" and "core/providers/cpu/nn" directories. It also utilizes modules such as "topi/nn/pooling", math, tensor, transpose, binary_ops, unary_ops, matmul_ops, reduce_ops, reshape_ops, and split. Additionally, it includes utility functions from mti_tvm_utils.h. The pooling and convolution operations handle downsampling, feature extraction, padding, stride configurations, and compatibility with different data layouts. The LSTM_cell function is called from other parts of the project where LSTM computations are required.
