contains code for performing various mathematical operations on tensors using the TVM library. It includes functions for binary operations such as addition, division, maximum, minimum, multiplication, subtraction, element-wise equality comparison, greater than comparison, and less than comparison. It also includes functions for matrix multiplication, reduction operations, softmax, log softmax, and various unary operations. These operations are used in the overall system architecture for tensor manipulation and computation in the project.
