contains code related to the creation and evaluation of intermediate representation (IR) for TVM (Tensor Virtual Machine) code generation in the project. It includes implementations for creating IR for TVM operators, generic op IR creators, and op IR dispatchers. The directory also includes subdirectories for different areas of functionality, such as tensor operations, mathematical operations, and neural network operations. These subdirectories provide implementations for various operations, including data type conversion, concatenation, cropping, expansion, gathering, padding, reshaping, slicing, splitting, transposing, and conditional selection. Additionally, the directory handles the code generation for mathematical operations, such as binary operations, unary operations, and reduce operations, as well as specific operations like Clip, Gemm, LogSoftmax, MatMul, Softmax, and MatMulInteger. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in the project's machine learning functionality, specifically in the TVM code generation module, by providing implementations for convolution operations, LSTM cell computation, and pooling operations. Overall, the "op_ir_creator" directory is essential for generating optimized code for various operations in the project.
