contains the implementation of various OpIRCreators for different operations in the project. These OpIRCreators are responsible for evaluating operations such as Cast, Concat, Crop, Expand, Gather, GatherElements, Pad, Reshape, Shape, Slice, Split, Transpose, and Where. Each OpIRCreator takes input tensors, performs the necessary computations, and produces output tensors. These operations cover a wide range of functionality, including data type conversion, concatenation, cropping, expansion, gathering, padding, reshaping, slicing, splitting, transposing, and conditional selection. The directory plays a crucial role in the project's code generation process, as it handles the evaluation and generation of intermediate representation (IR) code for these operations.
