the functionality of creating the intermediate representation (IR) for convolution, LSTM cell computation, and various pool operations in the ONNX Runtime project. It interacts with other parts of the system by using the code generation context, TVM library for tensor operations, utility functions for attributes and shapes, and other OpIRCreators. It includes headers, uses functions and classes from different namespaces, and interacts with the ProtoHelperNodeContext class to handle the protobuf node context.
