contains code for the TVM code generation module of the project. It includes implementations for convolution operations, LSTM cell computation, and pooling operations. The Conv class handles convolution operations, supporting both 1D and 2D convolutions with various padding modes and group configurations. The LSTM class performs calculations for LSTM cell computation, producing hidden state and cell state outputs. The Pool Ops implementation defines macros and helper functions for pooling operations in neural networks. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in the project's machine learning functionality, specifically in the TVM code generation module.
