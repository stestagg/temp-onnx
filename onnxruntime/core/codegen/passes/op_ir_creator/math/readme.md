contains code for creating intermediate representation (IR) creators for various mathematical operations in the TVM code generation module of the project. It includes implementations for binary operations, binary comparison operations, unary operations, and reduce operations. These IR creators evaluate input tensors and generate corresponding output tensors using the TVM framework. The directory also includes implementations for specific operations such as Clip, Gemm, LogSoftmax, MatMul, Softmax, and MatMulInteger. These operations perform mathematical computations on input tensors and produce output tensors. The directory provides essential functionality for mathematical operations in the project's code generation process.
