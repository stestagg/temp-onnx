covers the functionality of creating the intermediate representation (OpIR) for the MatMulInteger operation in the ONNX Runtime project. It interacts with other parts of the system by including necessary headers and using functions and classes defined in those headers. It performs operations like subtraction and casting using functions from other files, and uses the CodeGenContext class and tvm::Tensor data structure from the CodeGen module. The code file contributes to the implementation of the MatMulInteger operation by performing necessary operations on input tensors and creating the OpIR for the operation.
