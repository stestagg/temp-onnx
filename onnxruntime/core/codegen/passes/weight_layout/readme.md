contains code related to weight layout transformations in the project. It includes files for different types of transformations such as tiling, transpose, and vertical stripes. These files provide functions to convert between nominal and actual coordinates, as well as calculate the actual shape of weight tensors after the transformations. The directory also includes a file that defines the WeightLayout class, which is responsible for creating a layout marshalling TVM operation. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in managing and transforming weight tensors in the project.
