covers the functionality of creating layout marshalling TVM operations for weight tensors in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes classes such as WeightLayout, WeightLayoutVerticalStripe2D, WeightLayoutTiling2D, and WeightLayoutTranspose2D, which handle different weight layout transformations for 2D tensors. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using utility functions from various namespaces, inheriting from the WeightLayout base class, and being used as a component in the overall weight layout optimization process.
