This directory covers the functionality of scheduling TVM operations for code generation in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for different scheduler rules and a scheduler for the Softmax operation. The code interacts with other parts of the project such as common code generation utilities, codegen context, and dispatcher classes. It also uses classes and functions from headers like "all_schedules.h" and "schedule_utils.h" and interacts with the CodeGenContext and ScheduleContext classes for scheduling operations on TVM tensors.
