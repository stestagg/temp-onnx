in the onnxruntime project contains code for TVM code generation and tensor manipulation. It includes subdirectories for TVM code generation, common utility functions, and various aspects of the code generation process. The "mti" subdirectory provides utility functions and operations for manipulating shapes, performing arithmetic operations, creating tensors, and handling TVM modules. It also implements tensor operations such as casting, concatenation, cropping, expansion, gathering, padding, reshaping, slicing, splitting, tiling, transposing, and selection. The "common" subdirectory contains utility functions and helper methods for working with nodes and graph structures, as well as the implementation of the CodeGenSettings class for managing code generation settings. The "passes" subdirectory includes code for scheduling tensors, creating and evaluating intermediate representation (IR) for TVM code generation, managing the code generation context, and performing weight layout transformations. It includes subdirectories for tensor scheduling optimization, creating and evaluating IR, managing the code generation context, and handling weight layout transformations. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in the project by providing essential functionality for TVM code generation and tensor manipulation.
