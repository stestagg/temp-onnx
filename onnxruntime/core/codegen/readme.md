This directory covers the functionality of scheduling TVM operations for code generation in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for different scheduler rules and a scheduler for the Softmax operation. The code interacts with other parts of the project such as common code generation utilities, codegen context, and dispatcher classes. It also uses classes and functions from headers like "all_schedules.h" and "schedule_utils.h" and interacts with the CodeGenContext and ScheduleContext classes for scheduling operations on TVM tensors.

Directory: onnxruntime/core/codegen/mti

Summary:
This directory covers the functionality of code generation for the Meta Tensor Interface (MTI) in the ONNX Runtime project. It provides utility functions for working with TVM (Tensor Virtual Machine) in the context of MTI code generation. This includes converting shapes to TVM arrays, calculating dimension sizes, rounding up values, concatenating shapes, renaming tensors, slicing shapes, checking dimensions, promoting expressions to tensors, and dumping TVM modules to files. These utility functions are used by other components of the project, such as the code generation module and the tensor reshape operations module. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using functions and classes from the "topi" and "tvm" namespaces for element-wise operations, tensor computations, and expressions. It also includes headers from the "core/codegen/common" and "core/codegen/mti" directories for common settings and utility functions. Additionally, it uses functions from the "reshape_ops.h" and "mti_tvm_utils.h" files for manipulating tensors and the "topi/nn/softmax.h" file for performing softmax operations.

Directory: onnxruntime/core/codegen/common

Summary:
This directory covers common utility functions and settings for code generation in the ONNX Runtime project. It provides functionality such as retrieving environment variables, calculating sizes and strides, determining target features, and managing code generation settings. These functions are used by other parts of the project, such as the code generation engine and graph optimization algorithms, to perform various tasks and interact with the system.
