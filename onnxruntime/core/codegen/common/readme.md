covers common utility functions and settings for code generation in the ONNX Runtime project. It provides functionality such as retrieving environment variables, calculating sizes and strides, determining target features, and managing code generation settings. These functions are used by other parts of the project, such as the code generation engine and graph optimization algorithms, to perform various tasks and interact with the system.
