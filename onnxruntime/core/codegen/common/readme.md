in the project contains various utility functions and helper methods for working with nodes and graph structures. It provides functions for getting keys and names of nodes and node arguments, checking if a node is recurrent or an alias, normalizing names, and handling subgraphs. Additionally, it includes functions for working with shapes and tensor data types. The directory also includes the implementation of the CodeGenSettings class, which manages and manipulates code generation settings. It provides methods to insert options, retrieve option values, check for the existence of options, and clear all options. The class also includes a method to dump all the options for debugging purposes. Furthermore, the directory contains common utility functions for the project, such as retrieving environment variables, calculating vector size, getting strides for a given shape, and obtaining target information for code generation based on the CPU architecture.
