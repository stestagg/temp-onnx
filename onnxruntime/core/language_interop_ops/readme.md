contains the implementation of functions and classes for loading and processing interoperation operations in a machine learning model. It includes functions for loading model files, parsing model protos, and handling custom operations. Additionally, it includes classes that enable interaction with Python libraries within the onnxruntime project, such as the PyOpLibProxy class for proxying interactions with Python libraries, the PyCustomKernel class for executing Python functions, and the PyCustomOp class for representing custom operators. These functionalities allow for the loading and execution of Python code within the onnxruntime framework.
