contains the implementation of classes that enable interaction with Python libraries within the onnxruntime project. It includes the PyOpLibProxy class, which acts as a proxy for interacting with Python libraries. Additionally, it defines the PyCustomKernel class, representing a custom kernel for executing Python functions, and the PyCustomOp class, representing a custom operator. These classes are used to load and execute Python code within the onnxruntime framework.
