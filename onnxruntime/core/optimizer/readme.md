covers the functionality of optimizing computations and transformations in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes files for optimizing transpose operations, computation optimization, Quantize-Dequantize (QDQ) transformations, and performing various actions during the optimization process. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by accessing and manipulating the graph structure, using optimizer utilities and graph utilities, and relying on the ONNX Runtime library, logging, and other utility functions.
