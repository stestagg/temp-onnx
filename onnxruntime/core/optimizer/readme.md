contains the implementation of various graph transformers and optimization techniques for the project. It includes files for fusing and optimizing specific operations, such as attention fusion, bias dropout fusion, and gelu fusion. The directory also includes transformers for layout transformation, quantize-dequantize optimization, and transpose optimization. These optimizations aim to improve the performance and efficiency of the computational graph by reducing redundant computations, fusing operations, and optimizing data layout.
