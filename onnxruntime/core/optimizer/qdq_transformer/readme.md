covers the functionality of the Quantize-Dequantize (QDQ) transformer in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes files that implement fusion rules for nodes like "Relu" and "QuantizeLinear", perform QDQ propagation transformations, ensure unique outputs for DQ nodes, clean up node sequences, convert weights from signed 8-bit to unsigned 8-bit format, and provide utility functions for the QDQ transformer. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using functions and classes from namespaces like "optimizer_utils", "graph_utils", "optimizer", "graph", and "core/graph". It checks node types, versions, and domains, manipulates the graph structure, accesses constant initializers, and performs operations on the graph using graph manipulation functions. It also relies on the ONNX Runtime library, logging, and other utility functions to perform the necessary checks, transformations, and cleanup operations.
