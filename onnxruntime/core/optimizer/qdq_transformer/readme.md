contains code for optimizing the quantize-dequantize (QDQ) operations in the project. It includes transformers for converting weights from signed int8 to unsigned int8, fusing Clip and QuantizeLinear nodes, ensuring unique dequantize nodes for each consumer node, performing final cleanup of back-to-back nodes, propagating quantization and dequantization operations, and converting int8_t to uint8_t. It also includes utility functions for the QDQ transformer. Additionally, the directory contains code for optimizing QDQ operations for the CPU execution provider, including node group selectors and actions for replacing nodes with quantized versions.
