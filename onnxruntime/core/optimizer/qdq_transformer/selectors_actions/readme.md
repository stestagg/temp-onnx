contains code for optimizing the QDQ (Quantize-Dequantize) operations in the model. It includes files for replacing specific nodes in a graph with quantized versions, setting optional zero point values for quantized nodes, and replacing different types of nodes with their quantized counterparts. The directory also implements the QDQSelectorActionTransformer, which transforms the code to optimize QDQ operations for the CPU execution provider. Additionally, it contains the implementation of various node group selectors for the QDQ. The shared subdirectory handles the registration of selectors for different types of operators and initializes the selectors map, responsible for selecting and returning QDQ node groups based on the input graph.
