covers the functionality of the Quantize-Dequantize (QDQ) transformer in the ONNX Runtime project. It defines rules, actions, and selectors for optimizing the computation graph by replacing nodes with quantization and dequantization operations. The code interacts with other parts of the project through the SelectorActionRegistry, QDQ actions, and selectors. It also interacts with utility functions and node attribute manipulation in the computational graph.
