covers the functionality of performing various actions during the optimization process in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes actions such as removing nodes, merging nodes, and creating replacement nodes in the graph. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using classes and functions from the "core" and "optimizer" namespaces, as well as the Graph class. It also relies on helper functions from other files to manipulate the graph structure and perform operations such as removing node output edges and moving input/output definitions. The actions defined in this directory are used by the optimizer to optimize the graph representation of ONNX models.
