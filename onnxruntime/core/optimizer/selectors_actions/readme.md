contains code for performing various actions on nodes in a graph as part of an optimization process. It includes files for removing, merging, and replacing nodes, as well as moving or removing input/output edges between nodes. The directory also includes the implementation of the SelectorActionTransformer class, which applies selectors and actions to optimize the graph. Additionally, there is a SelectorActionRegistry class for registering selectors and actions. The code allows for matching nodes with registered operators, running selectors to select nodes, and then running actions on the selected nodes. The directory also provides functionality for saving and applying runtime optimization records.
