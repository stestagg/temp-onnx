contains the implementation of layout transformation for ONNX graphs in the project. It includes files that provide functions to transform the layout of tensors in the graph, optimize the graph by removing unnecessary transpose nodes, and apply optimizations to transpose operations. The directory plays a significant role in optimizing the layout of input tensors in neural network models to improve performance.
