contains the implementation of various graph transformers and utility functions for optimizing computations in the project. It includes files for optimizing gather operations, reshaping nodes, and reordering nodes in the computational graph. The directory covers a wide range of functionality, such as inserting intermediate nodes, comparing input and output shapes, and updating the shapes of input and output nodes. These optimizations aim to improve the performance of the project by optimizing the computation flow and reducing unnecessary operations.
