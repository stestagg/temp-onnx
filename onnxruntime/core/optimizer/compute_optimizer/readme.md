covers the functionality of optimizing computation in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes classes and functions for performing upstream transformations, such as reordering nodes in the graph, and upstream gather and reshape optimizations. The code interacts with other parts of the project, such as the Graph, Node, and GraphViewer classes, as well as optimizer utilities and logging/error handling mechanisms. It also interacts with graph utilities, optimizers, and actors for specific optimization operations.
