covers the functionality of invoking ONNX operators in eager mode. It defines the ORTInvoker class, which is responsible for creating a graph, resolving it, and setting the execution provider type. It also computes the kernel for the operator and returns the outputs of the computation. This code interacts with other parts of the project such as the optimizer, model, op kernel, session, and environment.
