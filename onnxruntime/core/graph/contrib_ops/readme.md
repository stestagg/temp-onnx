covers various areas of functionality in the ONNX Runtime project, including collective operations for distributed training and communication, quantization, NHWC format operations, BERT model functions, range operations, diffusion model operators, deprecated operators for backward compatibility, shape inference functions, and utility functions for data conversion and TensorProto creation.

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using functions, classes, and constants from the ONNX_NAMESPACE and onnxruntime namespaces, as well as including headers from the core/framework, core/graph, and core/mlas directories. It also registers and defines schemas for the operations, propagates input types and shapes to output types and shapes, and utilizes helper functions and type constraints from other files.
