contains various files that define the schemas and implementations of contrib operators in the project. These operators include the AttnLSTMContribOp, which implements a one-layer RNN with an attention mechanism, and the GroupNorm operator, which applies group normalization to inputs. The directory also includes implementations of operations used in transformer-based models, such as attention mechanisms and layer normalization. Additionally, it contains code for collective operations used in distributed computing and communication, as well as shape inference functions for various operations. The directory covers a wide range of functionality related to neural network operations, normalization, distributed computing, and shape inference.
