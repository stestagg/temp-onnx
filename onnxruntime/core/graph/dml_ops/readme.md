contains the schemas for several DirectML fused operators in the project. These operators, including Convolution, Convolution Transpose, Instance Normalization, Batch Normalization, Mean Variance Normalization, Gemm, MatMul, Add, and Sum, perform various mathematical operations and activations on input tensors. The schemas define the input and output types, attributes, and shape inference functions for each operator.
