covers the functionality related to the representation, manipulation, and analysis of computational graphs in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations of classes such as Graph, GraphViewer, Model, and FunctionImpl, as well as utility functions for working with graphs, node attributes, and op identifiers. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using classes and functions from namespaces such as ONNX_NAMESPACE, onnxruntime::common, and onnxruntime::OpIdentifier. It also includes headers from other parts of the project, such as graph_viewer.h, indexed_sub_graph.h, model.h, and others. Additionally, it interacts with the ONNX library and the ONNX Runtime project by using functions and classes from these libraries, such as mergeInShapeInfo, logging::Logger, Status, and others.
