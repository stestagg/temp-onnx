in the project contains code related to the graph structure and operations. It includes files for creating and manipulating function bodies, working with graph prototypes, saving and loading data in the ORT format, serializing graphs into protobuf format, analyzing and transforming graphs, and providing a non-mutable view of a computational graph. The directory also contains files for working with ONNX models, creating and setting attributes of ONNX nodes, handling attribute types, saving and loading OpIdentifiers, managing runtime optimization records, and registering operator schemas. Additionally, there are subdirectories for DirectML fused operators and contrib operators, which define the schemas and implementations of various mathematical operations, activations, normalization techniques, distributed computing and communication operations, and shape inference functions. Overall, the "graph" directory plays a crucial role in representing and manipulating the computational graph structure of the project.
