covers the functionality of logging messages with different severity levels for the ONNX Runtime project. It includes the implementation of the LoggingManager class for managing logging settings and methods for logging messages. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using the ISink interface to output log messages to a sink, and by using the exceptions module and ort_mutex module for error handling and thread safety. The LoggingManager class is used by other components of the project to log messages and control the logging behavior.

Interactions:
- Uses the ISink interface to output log messages to a sink.
- Interacts with the exceptions module for error handling.
- Interacts with the ort_mutex module for thread safety.
- Used by other components of the project to log messages and control logging behavior.
