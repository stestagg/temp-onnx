covers the implementation of various operators for the WebNN (Web Neural Network) execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes builders for operators such as ArgMax, ArgMin, Gemm, MatMul, Unary, Transpose, Ternary, Normalization, Expand, Reduction, Squeeze, Unsqueeze, Reshape, Softmax, Pool, Binary, Conv, Resize, Clip, Concat, Shape, Gather, Slice, and Activation.

The code in this directory interacts with other functional areas of the system by utilizing the ModelBuilder, Node, and logging classes from the ONNX Runtime framework. It also interacts with the WebNN API to perform operations on tensors. Additionally, it interacts with other builder classes, helper functions, and utility classes from the providers and shared utils of the ONNX Runtime to handle various aspects of building the operators, such as handling initializers, setting options, and checking operator support.
