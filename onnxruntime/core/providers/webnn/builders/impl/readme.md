contains the implementation files for various operators in the WebNN provider of the project. These files define classes responsible for adding specific operators to the model builder and checking if they are supported. The operators include activation functions (Relu, LeakyRelu, Sigmoid), binary operators (Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Pow), logical operators (Equal), normalization operations, pooling operations, reduction operations, reshape operations, and many others. Each file implements a specific operator builder class that handles the addition of the operator to the model builder and provides support for checking if the operator is supported. These files play a crucial role in defining the behavior and functionality of the WebNN provider in the project.
