contains the implementation files for various functions and classes used in the WebNN backend of the project. These files are responsible for checking if a node or input is supported by the WebNN platform, building a WebNN model from an ONNX graph, registering and retrieving operators for the WebNN backend, and implementing specific operators such as activation functions, binary operators, logical operators, normalization operations, pooling operations, reduction operations, and reshape operations. These files play a crucial role in defining the behavior and functionality of the WebNN provider in the project.
