contains the implementation files for the WebNN backend of the project. It provides execution capabilities for ONNX models using the WebNN framework. The directory includes files for creating the WebNN context and graph builder, compiling and executing models, and registering WebNN kernels in the kernel registry. Additionally, the "builders" subdirectory contains files responsible for checking node and input support, building WebNN models from ONNX graphs, and implementing various operators such as activation functions, binary operators, logical operators, normalization operations, pooling operations, reduction operations, and reshape operations. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in defining the behavior and functionality of the WebNN provider in the project.
