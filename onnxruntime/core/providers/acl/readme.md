covers the functionality of integrating the ACL (Arm Compute Library) execution provider into the ONNX Runtime framework. It includes the implementation of the ACLProviderFactory class, ACLExecutionProvider class, and ACL-specific op kernels. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by utilizing the Arm Compute Library for tensor operations, integrating with the ONNX Runtime framework for inference, and registering ACL-specific op kernels with the kernel registry. It also interacts with the ACL library for efficient execution of ONNX operators on Arm-based devices.
