covers the functionality of batch normalization, pooling, fused convolution, and convolution operations using the Arm Compute Library (ACL) for acceleration. It includes classes such as BatchNorm, Pool, MaxPoolV8, and FusedConv, which configure and execute these operations. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, accessing input and output tensors, and utilizing common utility functions. It also interacts with the ACL library for performing the operations efficiently.
