contains the implementation of various neural network operations using the ACL (Arm Compute Library) for the ONNX Runtime. It includes files for batch normalization, convolution, fused convolution, and pooling operations. These files provide functions that perform the respective operations using the ACL library, optimizing them for ARM-based devices. The code handles different cases such as depthwise convolution, pointwise convolution, and 2D convolution, and supports fused activation functions. It also includes optimizations for performance and memory allocation. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient neural network computations within the project.
