in the ONNX Runtime project contains the implementation of the Relu activation function using the ACL (Arm Compute Library). It defines a template class called Relu that computes the Relu activation on input tensors. The directory includes the necessary headers and imports memory using the ACLImportMemory function. The main functionality of this directory is to provide the computation of the Relu activation function using the ACL for the ONNX Runtime.
