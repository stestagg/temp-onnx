covers the functionality of the TensorRT execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes files for exporting the provider function, parsing provider options, implementing the execution provider, creating custom op domains, and defining the provider factory. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including various headers, interacting with CUDA functions, utilizing utility functions, and integrating with the ONNX Runtime framework. It enables efficient GPU acceleration of ONNX models by utilizing the TensorRT runtime.
