contains the implementation of the SNPE (Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine) execution provider for the ONNX Runtime. It includes files that define the SnpeKernel class for managing the Snpe operator kernel, the SNPEExecutionProvider class for providing execution capabilities using SNPE, and the SnpeLib class for setting up and executing the SNPE runtime for running neural networks. Additionally, there are files for parsing and storing runtime options, creating instances of the SNPEExecutionProvider, and setting the runtime configuration for SNPE. This directory plays a crucial role in enabling the ONNX Runtime to leverage the SNPE runtime for inference on Qualcomm Snapdragon devices.
