covers the functionality of tuning the performance of matrix multiplication operations (GEMM) on ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platforms. It includes implementations of GEMM operations for different scenarios, a tuning context for enabling/disabling tunable operations, a Timer class for measuring operation duration, and classes for registering and selecting the fastest GEMM implementations based on tuning. The code interacts with other parts of the system by including necessary headers, using functions and structures defined in those headers, and utilizing ROCm-specific libraries and APIs. It also interacts with the ROCm execution provider, tunable operation information, and the tuning results manager.
