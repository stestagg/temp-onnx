contains code related to tunable operations for the ROCm backend in the project. It includes implementations of the GEMM (General Matrix Multiply) function, tunable BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) operations, and a ROCm tuning context. These implementations provide optimized matrix multiplication and element-wise operations for the ROCm platform, with support for different data types and layouts. The code also includes functionality for pre and post-tuning operations, as well as timers for measuring operation durations in a ROCm environment.
