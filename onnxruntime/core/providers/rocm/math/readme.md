the implementation of various mathematical operations for the ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for operations such as softmax, matrix multiplication, Einsum, and auxiliary operations for the Einsum operator. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, utilizing common provider functions, ROCm-specific functions, tensor operations, and libraries such as ROCm, Triton, and ROCBLAS. It also uses tunable parameters for performance optimization and registers kernels for specific operators.
