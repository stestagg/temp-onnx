in the project contains the implementation of various mathematical operations for the ROCm execution provider in the ONNX Runtime. It includes files for operations such as Einsum, Gemm, MatMul, and Softmax. These files define the computation functions and utilize the ROCm library for optimized GPU computation. The directory also includes subdirectories for helper functions and a kernel function specific to the ROCm execution provider. Overall, the "math" directory plays a crucial role in providing essential mathematical functionality for the ROCm execution provider in the project.
