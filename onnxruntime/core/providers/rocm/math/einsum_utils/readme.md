auxiliary operations for the Einsum operator in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes functions for data copy, transpose, matrix multiplication, reduction, and diagonal operations specific to the ROCM EP. These operations interact with other parts of the project such as the ROCM EP, ROCM-specific tunable parameters, and the ROCBLAS library for matrix operations. They are used to perform computations required by the Einsum operator in the ONNX Runtime.

Interactions:
- Interacts with the ROCM EP for specific operations and tunable parameters.
- Interacts with the ROCBLAS library for matrix operations.
- Called from other parts of the project that require the diagonal operation.
