contains the implementation of various helper functions and a kernel function for the ROCM EP (Execution Provider) in the project. These functions are specific to the ROCM EP and are used in the main Einsum operation. The helper functions include data copy, transpose, matrix multiplication, reduce sum, and diagonal operations. The kernel function is responsible for parsing the diagonal elements of a tensor and is specialized for different element types. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in providing essential functionality for the ROCM EP in the project.
