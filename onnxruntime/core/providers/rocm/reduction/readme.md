contains the implementation of reduction operations for the ROCm execution provider in ONNX Runtime. It provides functions for computing various reduction operations such as argmax, argmin, reduce sum, reduce mean, reduce prod, reduce l1, reduce l2, reduce log sum, reduce sum square, and reduce log sum exp. The code utilizes the MIOpen library for GPU acceleration and supports different data types including float, double, int32, int64, and bfloat16. The implementation takes advantage of fast matrix reduction techniques when applicable and provides support for negative axes and OpSet 12 and OpSet 14 features.
