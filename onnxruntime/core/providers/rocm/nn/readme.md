covers the functionality of pooling operations, convolution operations, and convolution transpose operations for the ROCm execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for pooling, global pooling, pooling with indices, convolution, and convolution transpose. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using common utility functions, including ROCm-specific operations, element-wise operations, reduction operations, and tensor and slice functions. It also includes kernel definitions for different operations and their versions.
