in the onnxruntime/core/providers/xnnpack directory contains the implementation of various neural network operations for the XNNPack execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes files for operations such as AveragePool, Convolution, ConvBase, ConvTranspose, MaxPool, Resize, and Softmax. These files provide functionality for performing pooling, convolution, deconvolution, resizing, and softmax operations on input tensors using the XNNPack library. The implementation supports both floating-point and quantized data types, and handles different configurations and data types efficiently. The directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient execution of neural network operations using the XNNPack library within the ONNX Runtime project.
