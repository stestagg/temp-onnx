in the ONNX Runtime project contains files related to the XNNPACK provider. It includes an implementation of a node support checker, which verifies if a given node is supported by the XNNPACK provider and can be fused with another node. The directory also contains utility functions and helper methods for XNNPack optimization, such as data type conversion, shape and type retrieval, and fusion of quantized operations. Additionally, it provides functions for parsing and retrieving scale and zero-point values for quantization.
