covers the functionality related to the XNNPACK provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes utility functions and definitions for data type conversion, shape manipulation, quantized operation type determination, padding type support checking, and QDQ group fusion. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including headers from various modules and using enums and structs defined in those modules. It also defines a mapping between quantized operation types and their corresponding ONNX operation types. Additionally, the code includes support checker functions for different types of nodes, which validate if a node is supported based on certain criteria. These support checker functions rely on helper functions, classes, and specific operator implementations in the XNNPACK provider.
