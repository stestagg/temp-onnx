in the ONNX Runtime project contains the implementation of the XNNPACK execution provider, which enables optimized neural network inference using the XNNPACK library. It includes files for registering XNNPACK kernels, creating preferred allocators, and determining compute capabilities. The directory also provides memory allocation and deallocation functions using the XNNPACK library. Additionally, it includes the XnnpackProviderFactory and XnnpackProviderFactoryCreator classes for creating and configuring the XnnpackExecutionProvider. The "xnnpack" directory also contains subdirectories for mathematical computations related to matrix multiplication, node support checking, and neural network operations such as pooling, convolution, deconvolution, resizing, and softmax. These files support both floating-point and quantized data types and play a crucial role in enabling efficient execution of neural network operations using the XNNPACK library within the ONNX Runtime project.
