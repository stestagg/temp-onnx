contains the implementation of matrix multiplication operations using the XNNPACK library for the ONNX Runtime framework. It includes the Gemm class, which handles the initialization, packing of weights, and computation of matrix multiplication. Additionally, it includes the MatMul operation, which performs matrix multiplication between two input tensors. This directory is responsible for the mathematical computations related to matrix multiplication in the project.
