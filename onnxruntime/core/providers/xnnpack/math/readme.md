the functionality of matrix multiplication operations, specifically the Gemm and MatMul operations, for the XNNPACK provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations of the Gemm and MatMul classes, which handle the matrix multiplication calculations and optimization techniques. The code interacts with other parts of the project by checking for support, retrieving attributes and input definitions, and utilizing classes such as XnnpackKernel, GraphViewer, OpKernelInfo, and Tensor to perform computations and handle input/output data.
