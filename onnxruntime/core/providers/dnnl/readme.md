covers the functionality of the DNNL (Deep Neural Network Library) execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes the creation of instances of the DnnlExecutionProvider class, management of DNNL operations, execution of ONNX operations using oneDNN, and parsing and converting provider options related to the DNNL execution provider.

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary header files, accessing functions and classes from other directories, utilizing capabilities of DNNL operations, accessing platform-specific functionality, initializing the ONNX Runtime API, reading environment variables, retrieving nodes in the graph, logging information and errors, and performing computations and memory operations using the DNNL engine and memory descriptors.
