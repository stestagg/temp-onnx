in the ONNX Runtime project is responsible for implementing the DNNL (Deep Neural Network Library) execution provider. It includes files that handle the execution of ONNX models using DNNL primitives, such as compiling and executing subgraphs. The directory also contains files for managing the mapping between ONNX operators and DNNL capabilities, checking if specific operations are supported, and converting provider options. Additionally, the "subgraph" subdirectory within "dnnl" implements various classes and functions related to DNNL subgraphs, including creating and manipulating nodes, tensors, and node arguments, as well as implementing specific operations and utility functions. Overall, the "dnnl" directory plays a crucial role in optimizing the execution of ONNX models using the DNNL backend in the project.
