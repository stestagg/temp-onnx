in the ONNX Runtime project contains the implementation of various classes and functions related to the DNNL (Deep Neural Network Library) subgraph. It provides functionality for creating and manipulating a DNNL subgraph, including creating nodes, tensors, and node arguments, establishing inputs, outputs, and initializers, and performing topological sorting of the nodes. The directory also includes the implementation of specific operations such as batch normalization, binary operations, casting, concatenation, convolution, dequantize linear, dynamic quantize linear, elementwise operations, gelu, gemm, layer normalization, local response normalization, matrix multiplication, pooling, power, QAttention, reduction, ReLU gradient, reshape, softmax, squeeze, sum, transpose, and unsqueeze. Additionally, the directory contains utility functions for GPU availability and bfloat16 support, as well as a graph transformer for applying transformation rules to the graph. Overall, the "subgraph" directory plays a crucial role in the project by providing the necessary components for building and executing DNNL subgraphs efficiently.
