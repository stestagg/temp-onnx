in the project contains the implementation of various mathematical operations for the Cann execution provider. It includes files for binary elementwise operations, Gemm (matrix multiplication and addition), MatMul (matrix multiplication), and unary elementwise operations. These files provide functions and classes to perform computations on tensors of different data types using the ACL library for efficient computation on the Ascend AI processor. The directory plays a crucial role in enabling mathematical operations and computations within the project.
