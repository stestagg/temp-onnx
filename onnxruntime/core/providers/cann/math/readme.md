covers the functionality of performing matrix multiplication (MatMul) and binary elementwise operations (such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication) for the Huawei Ascend hardware using the CANN execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It also includes implementations for unary elementwise operations like logarithm and exponential. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using helper functions from the CPU math library, the ONNX Runtime API, and the Ascend Compute Library (ACL) to compute the matrix operations, access input and output tensors, set attributes, compile and execute the operations on the Ascend hardware.
