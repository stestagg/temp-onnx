covers the functionality of loading and executing ONNX models using the OpenVINO backend in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes the implementation of the BasicBackend class, which interacts with other parts of the project such as the GlobalContext, SubGraphContext, backend_utils, backend_manager, and the OpenVINO Inference Engine (IE) Core. The code in this directory also includes the BackendFactory class, which is responsible for creating backend objects for the OpenVINO execution provider. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by utilizing the BasicBackend class and the shared_library and provider_api namespaces.
