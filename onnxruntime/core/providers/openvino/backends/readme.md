contains the implementation of the OpenVINO backend for the ONNX Runtime project. It includes the factory class that creates backend objects based on the device type specified in the global context. The backend objects, implemented in the BasicBackend class, handle the loading and running of subgraphs using the OpenVINO Execution Provider. The BasicBackend class supports features such as model initialization, inference execution, caching, GPU throttling, and dynamic input shapes. It provides methods for starting and completing asynchronous inference requests, as well as filling input and output tensors with data.
