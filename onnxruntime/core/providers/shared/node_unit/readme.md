contains the implementation of the NodeUnit class, which represents a unit of computation in a graph. It provides functionality to identify and categorize different types of operations, such as QLinearOps, unary ops, binary ops, etc. The NodeUnit class also includes methods to retrieve input and output definitions for a given NodeUnit. Additionally, the directory includes functions to create NodeUnits for a given graph, including QDQ (quantize-dequantize) NodeUnits. This directory plays a crucial role in defining and managing the units of computation within the project's graph-based computations.
