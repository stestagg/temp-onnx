the functionality related to quantized linear operations (QLinearOps) in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes functions to determine the type of QLinearOp, check if an operation is unary, binary, or variadic, and retrieve input or output nodes and definitions for a given QDQ (Quantize-Dequantize) NodeGroup. The code interacts with other parts of the project such as the graph viewer, optimizer, and shared utility functions.
