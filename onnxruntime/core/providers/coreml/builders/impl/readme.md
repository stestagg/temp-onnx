contains the implementation of various builders for different operators in the CoreML provider of the project. These builders are responsible for adding specific operators to the CoreML model builder and checking if they are supported based on certain criteria. The files in this directory cover a wide range of functionality, including building activation operators, binary operators, convolutional neural network operators, pooling operators, reduction operators, reshape operators, and more. Each file focuses on a specific type of operator and provides methods and utilities for handling that operator in the CoreML model builder.
