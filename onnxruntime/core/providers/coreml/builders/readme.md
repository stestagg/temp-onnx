covers the functionality of building CoreML models from ONNX operators in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes classes and functions for registering and storing OpBuilder instances, helper functions for building CoreML models, and the main logic for building a CoreML model from an ONNX graph. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, using OpBuilder classes defined in other files, and relying on utility functions and classes. It also registers the model inputs and outputs, adds operations to the model, and interacts with the ModelBuilder class and OpBuilderRegistrations class. Additionally, the builders in the "impl" subdirectory interact with the ModelBuilder class, OpBuilderRegistrations class, and various utility functions and classes to add specific operators to the CoreML model.
