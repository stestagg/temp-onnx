contains protocol buffer files that define various models and data structures used in the CoreML specification. These files specify the structure, parameters, and functionality of different machine learning models such as regressors, classifiers, and feature extractors. They also define data types, mappings, and vectors used in the CoreML Specification. Additionally, the directory includes files for preprocessing operations, normalization, scaling, and non-maximum suppression. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in defining the models and data structures used in the CoreML project.
