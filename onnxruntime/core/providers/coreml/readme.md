covers the functionality of executing ONNX models using Apple's Core ML framework. It includes classes for creating instances of the CoreMLExecutionProvider, generating compute capabilities for ONNX graphs, compiling fused nodes into CoreML models, and executing the models using the CoreML runtime. The directory also includes functionality for building CoreML models from ONNX operators, handling input data and prediction using CoreML models, and defining the CoreML model format using protocol buffer messages.

Interactions with other functional areas:
- The CoreMLProviderFactory class interacts with the OrtSessionOptions structure to register the CoreML execution provider.
- The CoreMLExecutionProvider class integrates with the ONNX Runtime execution provider framework and utilizes CoreML-specific functionalities.
- The builders subdirectory interacts with OpBuilder classes, the ModelBuilder class, OpBuilderRegistrations class, and utility functions to build CoreML models from ONNX graphs.
- The model subdirectory interacts with the CoreML provider factory, helper functions, the CoreML framework, and ONNX Runtime components for input data handling and execution of CoreML models.
- The mlmodel_format subdirectory provides a standardized format for representing and exchanging CoreML models, which can be imported and used by other components or classes within the project.
