covers the functionality of implementing control flow operators (Scan, Loop, If) for the CUDA execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes the CUDA implementation of these operators, sets device helpers for GPU operations, and defines versioned kernel registrations. The code interacts with other parts of the system by calling the base CPU versions of the operators, using necessary headers, and utilizing classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime library.
