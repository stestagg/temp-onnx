contains the CUDA implementations of the If, Loop, and Scan operators for the project. These implementations enable the execution of these operators on the GPU, while keeping the inputs and outputs on the GPU where possible. The directory includes support for different versions of the operators, various data types, and memory types. Additionally, it provides helper functions for device operations such as setting data to zero and transposing tensors. The logic to run the subgraph for the If operator is still executed on the CPU.
