contains the CUDA implementation of key operations for object detection in the project. It includes the NonMaxSuppression class, which performs non-maximum suppression on object detection results. It also includes the RoiAlign operation, which computes aligned regions of interest in the input tensor. These implementations leverage CUDA for efficient parallel processing on GPUs. The directory plays a crucial role in enabling object detection functionality in the project.
