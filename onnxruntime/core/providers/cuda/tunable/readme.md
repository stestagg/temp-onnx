contains files that implement functionality related to CUDA tuning in the project. It includes the implementation of the CUDA tuning context, which enables/disables tunable operations and tuning, sets maximum tuning duration, and manages tuning results. The directory also includes a Timer class implementation that measures the duration of GPU operations using CUDA events. Additionally, there are validators for CUDA version and device model to ensure compatibility with the tuning results.
