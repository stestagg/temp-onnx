covers the functionality of the CUDA tunable module in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes utility functions for measuring the duration of CUDA operations using a Timer class. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers and making CUDA API calls to create and destroy events, record and synchronize events, and calculate the elapsed time. It also implements the CUDA tuning context, providing functionality to enable/disable tunable operations and tuning, set the maximum tuning duration, and manage tuning results. The code interacts with the CUDA execution provider, accesses device properties, and validates CUDA version and device model for tuning results.
