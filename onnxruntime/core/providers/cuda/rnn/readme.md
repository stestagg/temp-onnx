covers the functionality of implementing RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) operators, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), for the CUDA execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes files for the RNN operator implementation, CUDA kernels for various RNN operations, and a base class for the CUDA implementation of RNN operations using cuDNN. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, such as "rnn.h", "rnn_impl.h", "cudnn_common.h", and "provider_api.h". It also registers the RNN and GRU operators as kernels with different versions and data types using macros. The higher-level RNN operations implemented in other files call the functions in this directory to perform specific computations related to reversing and reordering RNN data. The code also relies on the shared_library module for dynamic linking and uses various cuDNN functions and descriptors for RNN operations.
