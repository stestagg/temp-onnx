the implementation of various activation functions for the CUDA provider in the ONNX Runtime project. These activation functions include Elu, HardSigmoid, LeakyRelu, Relu, Selu, Sigmoid, Softplus, Softsign, Tanh, and ThresholdedRelu. The code defines structs for each activation function and uses them in the UnaryElementWiseImpl function to apply the activation functions element-wise on input data. The code interacts with other parts of the project by being part of the CUDA provider and providing the necessary activation functions for CUDA-based computations. It also registers versioned and non-versioned activation kernels for different data types and includes template functions for computing the activation function on input tensors of different data types.
