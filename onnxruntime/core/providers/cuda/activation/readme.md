contains the implementation of various activation functions for the CUDA execution provider in the project. It includes functions such as Elu, HardSigmoid, LeakyRelu, Relu, Selu, Sigmoid, Softplus, Softsign, Tanh, and ThresholdedRelu. The code registers and defines the versions and types of these activation functions for the CUDA execution provider. Additionally, the directory includes the implementation of these activation functions for the CUDA backend, utilizing CUDA parallelism for efficient execution on GPU devices.
