covers functionality related to CUDA operations in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes common functions and operators for CUDA operations, implementation of unary and binary element-wise operations, and a CUDA kernel for performing element-wise operations on multiple input arrays. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, using utility functions and types defined in other CUDA-related files, and being called from other CUDA functions or kernels that require element-wise operations.
