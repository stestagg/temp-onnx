covers the functionality of generating sequences of values, random number generation, and creating tensors filled with constant values on CUDA using the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for the Range operator, random number generation operators, and the ConstantOfShape operator. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers, using common CUDA functions and types, and registering operator kernels with the CUDA execution provider. It also works with tensors and generators provided by the ONNX Runtime framework and accesses device properties.
