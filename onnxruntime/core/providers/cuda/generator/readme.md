in the ONNX Runtime project contains files related to generating tensors and sequences of numbers for the CUDA execution provider. It includes implementations for operators such as ConstantOfShape, Range, and random number generation. These files provide functionality for computing output tensors based on input shapes, filling tensors with constant values, generating random numbers from different distributions, and generating sequences of numbers within specified ranges. The code in this directory utilizes CUDA parallelism and optimizations to efficiently perform these computations on GPUs.
