contains code for matrix reduction operations in the CUDA provider of the project. It includes functions for determining if a reduction operation is applicable and calculating the dimensions of the resulting matrix. The code handles cases where input dimensions have a value of 1 and optimizes the operation by removing those dimensions. It also provides CUDA implementations for reducing matrices by rows or columns using various reduction operations such as sum, square sum, L2 norm, and mean. The code efficiently performs the reductions using shared memory and thread-level reductions. Additionally, it includes functions for reducing tensors along specified axes, such as computing the maximum, minimum, sum, mean, and product. The code utilizes the cuDNN library for efficient GPU acceleration of these operations. The directory also contains CUDA implementations of mathematical functions and a function to find the least power of 2 that is greater than a given value.
