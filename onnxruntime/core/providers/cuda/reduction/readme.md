covers the functionality of performing reduction operations on CUDA devices in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes utility functions and structs for reduction operations, functions for determining if a reduction operation is applicable and getting the minimum and maximum contiguous axes, as well as kernel implementations for reduction operations such as sum, mean, min, max, etc. The code interacts with other parts of the system by including necessary headers, using functions and types from those headers, and being included and used in other CUDA provider files that require reduction functionality.
