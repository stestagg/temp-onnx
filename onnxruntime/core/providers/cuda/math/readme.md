contains the implementation of various mathematical operations for the CUDA execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes functions for binary elementwise operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, modulo, and comparison operations. The directory also includes implementations for the Clip operator, Cumulative Sum (CumSum) operator, Einsum operator, Gemm operation, MatMul operation, MatMulInteger operation, SoftMax operation, TopK operator, and unary elementwise operations. These implementations are specialized for CUDA devices and utilize CUDA-specific methods and libraries for efficient computation on NVIDIA GPUs. The directory also includes helper functions, CUDA kernels, and device functors for performing computations on scalars and tensors.
