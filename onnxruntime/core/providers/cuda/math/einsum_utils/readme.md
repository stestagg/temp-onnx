provides auxiliary operations for the Einsum operator in the CUDA execution provider of ONNX Runtime. It includes functions for data copy, transpose, matrix multiplication, and reduce sum operations specific to the CUDA execution provider. These functions interact with other parts of the project by utilizing the CUDA execution provider's device properties, CUDA stream, and cuBLAS handle. They also make use of the ThreadPool for parallel execution. The code in the file "einsum_auxiliary_ops_diagonal.cu" implements the CUDA kernel for the diagonal operation used in the einsum auxiliary operations. This code defines a CUDA kernel function that extracts the diagonal elements from a tensor along specified axes and is called from other parts of the project that require the diagonal operation.
