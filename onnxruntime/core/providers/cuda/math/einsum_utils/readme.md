contains CUDA-specific helper functions and implementations for the Einsum operation in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes functions for data copy, transpose, matrix multiplication, reduction, and diagonal operations. These functions are used to perform computations on CUDA-enabled devices, specifically for the diagonal operation which extracts diagonal elements from a tensor along specified axes and returns a new tensor with reduced rank.
