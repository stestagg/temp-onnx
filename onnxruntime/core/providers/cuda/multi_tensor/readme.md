covers the functionality of handling parallel tensors in CUDA operations. It defines a template struct called ChunkGroup, which represents a group of parallel tensors and provides information about the number of chunks, chunk size, and the mapping between block indices and tensor indices. The directory also includes functions for launching multi-tensor functors on CUDA, which take a stream, chunk size, and tensor sizes as input. This code interacts with other parts of the project by providing a common data structure and functions for handling parallel tensors in CUDA operations.
