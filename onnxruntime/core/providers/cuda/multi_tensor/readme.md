contains code for launching multi-tensor CUDA kernels in the project. It defines a struct called ChunkGroup to represent groups of parallel tensors. The code provides functions for launching the kernel with different tensor group sizes and handles the processing of multiple tensors per kernel call. It also includes constants for determining maximum block counts, tensor group counts, and thread counts per block for different tensor group sizes.
