contains the implementation of the Neural Network API (NNAPI) for a specific project. It includes files that define the type and shape of operands in a neural network, implement the NNAPI functionality, and provide default implementations for the NNAPI. This directory is responsible for handling operations, determining the Android SDK version and NNAPI runtime feature level, and providing platform-specific implementations for shared memory and Android-specific functions.
