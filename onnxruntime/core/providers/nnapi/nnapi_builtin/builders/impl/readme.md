contains the implementation files for various operators in the NNAPI (Android Neural Networks API) backend of the ONNX Runtime project. These files define classes responsible for building specific operators, such as LRN (Local Response Normalization), batch normalization, binary operations, casting, clipping, concatenation, convolution, depth-to-space, dequantization, ELU activation, flattening, gathering, Gemm (matrix multiplication and addition), identity, min and max operations, padding, pooling, quantization, reduction, ReLU activation, reshaping, resizing, slicing, softmax, squeezing, transposing, unary operations, and unsqueezing. Each class handles adding the corresponding operator to the NNAPI model builder, checking for operator support, and handling specific functionalities and requirements of the operator. These files play a crucial role in defining and implementing the supported operators in the NNAPI backend of the ONNX Runtime project.
