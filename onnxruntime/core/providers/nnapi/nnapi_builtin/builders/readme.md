in the project contains files that are responsible for building and constructing the Neural Network API (NNAPI) model in the ONNX Runtime. These files include helper functions for error handling, quantization and convolution type identification, and checking the support of nodes in the NNAPI provider. Additionally, there are files that implement the ModelBuilder class, which converts ONNX operations to NNAPI operations and handles the registration of model inputs, initializers, and outputs. The op builder factory file creates and registers op builders for various operations, while the op builder helpers file provides functions for building specific operations in the NNAPI backend. The "impl" subdirectory contains implementation files for various operators in the NNAPI backend, defining classes responsible for building and handling specific operators. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in defining and implementing the supported operators in the NNAPI backend of the ONNX Runtime project.
