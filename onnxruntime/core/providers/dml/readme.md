covers the functionality of creating and configuring the DirectML execution provider for the ONNX Runtime. It includes the DMLProviderFactory class, which is responsible for creating and configuring the DmlExecutionProvider. The code also includes helper functions for operators and graph transformers.

Interactions with other functional areas:
- The DMLProviderFactory interacts with the D3D12 devices to create and configure the DmlExecutionProvider.
- The helper functions in the OperatorAuthorHelper directory are used by other parts of the project to perform various operations on tensors.
- The graph transformers in the GraphTransformers directory optimize computational graphs by fusing batch normalization and addition/multiplication operations. They interact with other parts of the project by accessing and modifying the graph structure and initializers, as well as registering graph transformers in the InferenceSession.
