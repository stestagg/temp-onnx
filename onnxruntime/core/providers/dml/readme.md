contains the implementation of the DMLProviderFactory, which is responsible for creating and configuring the DirectML execution provider. It also includes various components and functionalities for the DML execution provider, such as registering custom operator schemas and kernels, managing memory resources, executing commands on a DirectX 12 device, handling data type conversion and manipulation, and optimizing graph partitions. These components and functionalities are essential for the efficient execution and optimization of deep learning models using DirectML. Additionally, the directory includes helper functions for handling operations and data types, as well as files that register graph transformers for optimizing the graph during inference.
