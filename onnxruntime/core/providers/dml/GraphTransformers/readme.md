covers the functionality of optimizing computational graphs by fusing batch normalization and addition/multiplication operations. It implements fusion optimization rules for batch normalization and addition/multiplication nodes, modifies initializers, and removes unnecessary nodes from the graph. The code interacts with other parts of the project by accessing and modifying the graph structure and initializers, as well as registering graph transformers in the InferenceSession.
