contains files that register graph transformers for the system. These transformers are responsible for optimizing the graph during inference by performing fusion and elimination operations. The files in this directory include implementations of fusion rules for batch normalization and addition operations, as well as batch normalization and multiplication operations. These fusion rules combine specific nodes into single nodes with updated initializers, optimizing the graph by improving compatibility and removing unnecessary nodes.
