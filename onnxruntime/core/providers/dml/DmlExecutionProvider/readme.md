contains the implementation of various components and functionalities for the DML (DirectML) execution provider in the project. It includes classes for registering custom operator schemas and kernels, managing memory resources, executing command lists on a DirectX 12 device, managing descriptor heaps, recording and executing DML commands, allocating committed resources, handling data type conversion and manipulation, creating and manipulating DML resources and graphs, fusing and optimizing graph partitions, managing the execution of DirectML operations on a D3D12 device, executing ONNX models on DML-compatible GPUs, executing a compiled execution plan for a fused graph, building graph descriptions for machine learning models, partitioning graphs into smaller subgraphs, transforming graphs by fusing nodes, managing upload heaps for data transfer, managing readback heaps for efficient data reading from the GPU, managing tensor descriptions, and implementing various operators for performing computations and operations on input tensors. These components and functionalities are essential for the efficient execution and optimization of deep learning models using DirectML.
