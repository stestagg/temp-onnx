Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality of computing the chirp signal used in the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) using the Bluestein algorithm, implementing the grid sampling operation, and performing the DFT computation using the Cooley-Tukey algorithm. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by providing the implementation for the chirp calculation step in the DFT computation, reading input data from structured buffers, applying grid sampling using various modes, and writing the sampled data to output buffers. It also relies on constants and buffers defined in the cbuffer and RWStructuredBuffer declarations, as well as helper functions defined within the shader files to decompose indices, fetch grid vectors, calculate borders, and denormalize input coordinates. Additionally, it interacts with the DML Execution Provider and the overall ONNX Runtime framework to enable efficient DFT computation on supported hardware.
