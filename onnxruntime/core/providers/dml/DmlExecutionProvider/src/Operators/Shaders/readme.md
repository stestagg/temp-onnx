contains HLSL shader files that are used in the project for various computations. These shaders include a compute shader for performing Bluestein's algorithm for zero-padded chirp multiplication, a shader function for grid sampling with different interpolation modes, and a shader code for performing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on input data. These shaders handle complex calculations and operations such as calculating indices, computing chirp values, performing interpolation, and applying window functions. They play a crucial role in the project's functionality by enabling efficient and parallel execution of these computations on the GPU.
