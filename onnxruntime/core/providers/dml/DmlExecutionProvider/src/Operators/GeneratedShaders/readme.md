is responsible for compiling shaders used in the DMLExecutionProvider component of the ONNX Runtime project. It uses the fxc.exe and dxc.exe compilers to generate shader header files for different shader configurations. These shaders are used for various operations in the DMLExecutionProvider. The generated header files are then used by other parts of the project to execute these shaders efficiently on DirectML hardware.
