covers the functionality of building providers as a DLL in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes headers, functions, and classes related to the provider API, as well as implementations for control flow, tensor manipulation, and optimization. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using common functions and classes defined in shared headers and by including specific headers for additional operations. It also interacts with the provider host and CPU-specific functions through the ProviderHost and ProviderHostCPU objects. Additionally, the code defines an allocator for CPU memory and handles memory allocation and deallocation.
