the functionality of building various operators for quantized neural network (QNN) models in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes classes for building operators such as Resize, Pool, Gather, ArgMax/ArgMin, Gemm, Simple, Clip, Reshape, Reduce, Split, InstanceNorm, BatchNorm, Conv, LRN, Cast, Tile, and TopK. These classes inherit from the BaseOpBuilder class and provide methods for validating and processing inputs, attributes, and outputs of the respective operators. The code interacts with other parts of the project, such as the QnnModelWrapper class, logging utilities, and other op
