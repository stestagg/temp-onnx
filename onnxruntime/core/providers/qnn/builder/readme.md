contains the implementation of various classes responsible for building different operations in a quantized neural network model. These classes handle the processing of inputs, attributes, and outputs for operations such as ArgMax, ArgMin, BatchNorm, Cast, Clip, Convolution, Gather, Gemm, InstanceNorm, LRN, Pool, Reduce, Reshape, Resize, Slice, Split, Tile, and TopK. They perform validation checks, handle data types, create necessary parameter tensors, and add nodes to the model graph. These classes play a crucial role in the project by providing the functionality to build and process these operations in a quantized neural network model.
