contains the implementation of the QNNExecutionProvider class, which is responsible for executing quantized neural network models. It also includes the QNNProviderFactory class, which creates instances of the QNNExecutionProvider. The directory also contains a subdirectory called "builder" that implements various classes for building different operations in a quantized neural network model. These classes handle input processing, attribute handling, output processing, and validation checks for operations such as ArgMax, ArgMin, BatchNorm, Convolution, and more. Overall, the "qnn" directory plays a crucial role in providing the functionality to build and process operations in a quantized neural network model.
