covers the implementation of various activation functions for the CPU provider in the ONNX Runtime project. These activation functions include Elu, HardSigmoid, LeakyRelu, Relu, Selu, Sigmoid, Softplus, Softsign, Tanh, Celu, and ThresholdedRelu. The code defines and registers kernel functions for each activation function, performs element-wise transformations on input tensors, and handles different versions and data types of the activation functions. It interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary header files and potentially additional activation functions from the "contrib_ops" module.
