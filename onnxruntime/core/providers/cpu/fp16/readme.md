contains the implementation of operators and classes for working with FP16 tensors in the project. It includes files for performing convolution operations with support for different layouts and optional fused operations. Additionally, it includes a file for performing max pooling and average pooling operations on FP16 data, with support for both single-threaded and multi-threaded operations. The pooling operations handle data conversion between different formats and use the MLAS library for efficient computation. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient computation and manipulation of FP16 tensors in the project.
