in the ONNX Runtime project contains the implementation of various machine learning operators and models. These include operators for data manipulation and transformation, such as array feature extraction, binarization, casting of map values, category mapping, dictionary vectorization, feature vectorization, imputation, label encoding, normalization, one-hot encoding, scaling, and zip mapping. It also includes the implementation of linear classifiers, linear regressors, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and regressors, and tree ensemble classifiers and regressors. These operators and models provide essential functionality for performing machine learning tasks within the project.
