covers various machine learning operators and models for the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for operators such as OneHotEncoder, Imputer, DictVectorizer, TreeEnsembleRegressor, LinearRegressor, SVMRegressor, LinearClassifier, ZipMap, LabelEncoder, CastMap, Scaler, SVMClassifier, CategoryMapper, ArrayFeatureExtractor, Binarizer, Normalizer, and FeatureVectorizer. These operators handle tasks such as encoding, imputing, vectorizing, regression, classification, mapping, scaling, and normalization. The code interacts with other parts of the project through the use of OpKernelInfo, OpKernelContext, and Tensor classes, as well as through the registration of operators with the ONNX Runtime framework. It also relies on helper functions, header files, and classes from the project to perform computations and handle input/output data.
