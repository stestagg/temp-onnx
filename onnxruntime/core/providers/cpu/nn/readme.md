contains the implementation of various neural network operations for the CPU provider in the project. It includes operators such as MaxUnpool, Batch Normalization, Convolution, ConvTranspose, Dropout, Flatten, InstanceNormalization, LayerNormalization, LpNormalization, LRN, Pooling (MaxPool, AveragePool, LpPool), MaxRoiPool, Shrink, StringNormalizer, and TfIdfVectorizer. These operators handle tasks such as unpooling, normalization, convolution, dropout, flattening, instance normalization, layer normalization, Lp normalization, local response normalization, pooling, region of interest pooling, shrinkage, string normalization, and TF-IDF vectorization. The implementations support various data types, handle different versions of the ONNX specification, and optimize computations using matrix multiplication and parallel processing.
