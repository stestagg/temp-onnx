contains the implementation of various sequence operations in the project. These operations allow for manipulation of sequences of tensors, such as getting the length of a sequence, accessing specific tensors, creating empty sequences, inserting and erasing tensors, constructing sequences from multiple tensors, and splitting tensors into multiple sequences. The code handles different data types and supports both scalar and non-scalar split inputs. The directory plays a crucial role in enabling sequence-related functionality within the project.
