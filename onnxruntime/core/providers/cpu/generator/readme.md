in the ONNX Runtime project contains code related to generating tensors with constant values, random number generation, and generating sequences of numbers. It includes implementations of the ConstantOfShape operator, which generates a tensor of a specified shape with constant values, and the Range operator, which generates a sequence of numbers within a specified range. The code uses the CPU execution provider and supports different data types for the generated values.
