contains the implementation of various classes and operators for performing quantization-related operations in the project. It includes classes for integer-based convolution, dynamic quantization, matrix multiplication with integer data types, quantized linear convolution, and quantization and dequantization operations. These implementations handle the computation of convolution, matrix multiplication, scaling, zero-point calculation, and conversion between floating-point and quantized representations of tensors. The directory also includes functions for computing kernel shape, padding, output shape, offsets, output scales, and output strides. The implementations support different data types for input and output tensors and can perform operations in parallel using multiple threads.
