contains the implementation of key algorithms and operations for object detection tasks in the project. It includes the NonMaxSuppression algorithm, which selects relevant bounding boxes based on scores and suppresses overlapping boxes. Additionally, it includes the RoiAlign operation, which performs region of interest pooling on input feature maps to produce pooled feature maps based on specified ROI regions. The directory supports both CPU and GPU execution for these functionalities.
