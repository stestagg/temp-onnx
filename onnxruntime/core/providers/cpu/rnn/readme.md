contains the implementation of various recurrent neural network (RNN) operations for CPU execution in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes classes and functions for computing the forward pass of GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) operations. The code handles the application of weights, biases, and activation functions, as well as the clipping of values. It supports both unidirectional and bidirectional RNNs, with various activation functions. The implementation includes matrix operations, memory allocation, and handling of sequence lengths and initial hidden states.
