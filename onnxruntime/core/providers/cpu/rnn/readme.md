the functionality of implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) operations for the CPU provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes files for the base class of LSTM, unidirectional LSTM, RNN helpers, one-layer LSTM, one-layer GRU, and the RNN operator. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary header files, accessing input and output tensors, utilizing the concurrency::ThreadPool and AllocatorPtr provided by the context, and using helper functions and data structures defined in different files. It also interacts with other components of the LSTM and GRU layers, such as activation functions, bias values, peephole weights, and initial hidden and cell states. The code performs validation on input tensors, handles optional inputs and outputs, and provides methods for loading peephole weights and bias values.
