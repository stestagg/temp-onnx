contains the implementation of signal processing operations and functions in the project. It includes the implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) operations, which are used to analyze the frequency content of a signal. The code supports both real-valued and complex-valued signals and provides options for one-sided spectra and inverse transforms. Additionally, the directory includes the implementation of several signal processing functions, such as window functions (HannWindow, HammingWindow, BlackmanWindow) and the MelWeightMatrix function. These functions are used to create various types of windows and weight matrices commonly used in signal processing tasks. The directory plays a crucial role in enabling signal analysis and processing capabilities within the project.
