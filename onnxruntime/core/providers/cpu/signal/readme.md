covers the functionality of implementing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) operations for the CPU provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It also includes the implementation of window functions used in signal processing.

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including various header files from the ONNX Runtime project, such as "core/framework/op_kernel.h", "core/platform/threadpool.h", "core/providers/common.h", "core/providers/cpu/signal/utils.h", and "core/util/math_cpuonly.h". These header files provide necessary definitions and functions for the DFT and STFT operations, as well as other common utilities and dependencies. The code also uses the ONNX_CPU_OPERATOR_KERNEL macro to register the kernel functions for the window functions. It relies on the ONNX Runtime framework for execution and utilizes the OpKernelContext and Tensor classes for input and output handling.
