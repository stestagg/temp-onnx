contains the implementation of various mathematical operations for the CPU execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes operators such as Clip, CumSum, Det, Einsum, Element-wise operations, Gemm, Hardmax, MatMul, Round, Sign, Softmax, LogSoftmax, SoftmaxShared, and TopK. These operators perform tasks such as element-wise clipping, cumulative sum computation, determinant calculation, generalized matrix multiplication, element-wise mathematical operations, matrix multiplication with optional activation function, hard maximum computation, rounding, sign computation, softmax and log softmax computation, and selecting top k elements. The directory also includes a subdirectory "einsum_utils" that provides CPU-specific helper functions and classes for the EinsumOp module, including data copy, transpose, matrix multiplication, reduce sum, diagonal operations, and preprocessing and processing of inputs for the Einsum operation. Overall, the "math" directory plays a crucial role in providing essential mathematical functionality for the ONNX Runtime project.
