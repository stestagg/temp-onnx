contains CPU-specific helper functions and classes for the EinsumOp module. It includes functions for data copy, transpose, matrix multiplication, reduce sum, and diagonal operations. Additionally, it contains the implementation of the EinsumComputePreprocessor class, which preprocesses inputs and calculates the output shape for the Einsum operation. The directory also includes the implementation of the EinsumTypedComputeProcessor class, which processes inputs and performs the einsum operation, including finalizing the output and pairwise operand processing. Overall, the directory provides essential functionality for mathematical operations required by the EinsumOp module in the project.
