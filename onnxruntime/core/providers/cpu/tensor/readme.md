in the ONNX Runtime project contains the implementation of various tensor-related operations and operators for the CPU execution provider. These operations include type casting, image manipulation, compression, concatenation, expansion, gathering, grid sampling, identity operations, checking for infinity and NaN values, mean variance normalization, finding non-zero elements, one-hot encoding, padding, reshaping, resizing, reversing sequences, scatter and scatter elements operations, shape computation, size computation, slicing, space-to-depth and depth-to-space operations, splitting, squeezing, tiling, transposing, computing lower or upper triangular parts of a matrix, finding unique values, unsqueezing, upsampling, and selecting elements based on conditions. The directory contains the necessary code for implementing these operations efficiently and handling different data types and versions of the operators.
