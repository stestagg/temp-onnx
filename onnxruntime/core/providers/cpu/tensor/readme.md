covers various tensor operations for the CPU execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for operations such as Split, SpaceToDepth, DepthToSpace, Size, Shape, Squeeze, ScatterND, NonZero, ReverseSequence, Expand, Cast, Where, EyeLike, Compress, Transpose, Gather, Concat, GatherElements, IsInf, Unique, Trilu, IsNaN, GridSample, OneHot, Tile, Slice, Upsample, Scatter, Resize, Unsqueeze, Reshape, Col2Im, Identity, Dropout, Pad, MeanVarianceNormalization, and GatherND. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, using common utility functions, and registering the operators as kernels with the ONNX Runtime framework. It also utilizes the Eigen library for efficient tensor operations and interacts with other components of the project, such as the CPU execution provider, common utility functions, math functions, and the ONNX specification.
