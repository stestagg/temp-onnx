the functionality related to control flow operators in the CPU provider of the ONNX Runtime project. It includes implementations for If, Scan, and Loop operators. The code defines the schemas, inputs, outputs, attributes, and type constraints for these operators. It also provides utility functions for control flow operations. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary headers, using namespaces, and utilizing classes and functions from the ONNX Runtime framework. It interacts with the controlflow, framework, providers, and common parts of the project. It uses utility functions and classes from the controlflow, framework, and providers namespaces. It also handles data types, performs type and shape inference, and uses the ONNX Runtime allocator, session state, session options, and tensor utilities.
