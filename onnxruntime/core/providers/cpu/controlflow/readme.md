contains the implementation of control flow operators in the ONNX Runtime project. These operators include If, Loop, and Scan, which enable conditional execution, looping, and sequence processing within the runtime. The implementation handles the initialization, execution, and output allocation for these operators, as well as the handling of input and output tensors. This directory plays a crucial role in enabling advanced control flow functionality within the ONNX Runtime.
