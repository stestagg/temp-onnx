the implementation of various reduction operations for the CPU provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes functions like sum, mean, min, max, etc. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers and uses macros to register the reduction operations as operators with the appropriate data type constraints. This code contributes to the functionality of the CPU provider by providing efficient implementations of reduction operations.
