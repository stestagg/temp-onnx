contains the implementation of various reduction operations for different data types. It provides optimized implementations for fast reduction on specific shapes and axes. The reduction operations are performed on input tensors based on the specified axes, and the results are stored in the output tensor. The directory also includes helper functions for preparing the input and output shapes, as well as for optimizing the reduction process.
