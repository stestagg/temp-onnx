in the project contains the implementation of the Relu operator for the ArmNN execution provider. It defines the Compute function that performs the Relu operation on the input tensor and produces the output tensor. Additionally, it handles the creation and optimization of the ArmNN network and executes the workload. This directory is responsible for the functionality related to the activation operations in the project.
