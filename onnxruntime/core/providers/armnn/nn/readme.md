in the ArmNN execution provider of the project contains the implementation of various neural network operations, such as Batch Normalization, Convolution, Fused Convolution, and Pooling. These operations are optimized and executed using the ArmNN library and runtime. The files in this directory define classes and functions that handle the computation and management of these operations, including creating descriptors, applying activation functions, and handling different types of convolutions and pooling. This directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient and optimized neural network computations within the project.
