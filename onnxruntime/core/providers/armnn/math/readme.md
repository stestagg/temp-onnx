covers the functionality of the Gemm operator for the ArmNN execution provider in the ONNX Runtime project. It implements matrix multiplication and addition. The code interacts with other parts of the project by including necessary headers and defining the Gemm operator for the ArmNN execution provider. It specifies the versioned and non-versioned kernel definitions for the Gemm operator and defines the type constraint for the input tensor. The Gemm operator is implemented as a template class with the data type as a template parameter.
