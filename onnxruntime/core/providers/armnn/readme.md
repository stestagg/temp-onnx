in the project contains the implementation of the ArmNN execution provider for the ONNX Runtime. It includes various files and subdirectories that handle different aspects of the ArmNN execution provider, such as converting tensor shapes, registering ArmNN kernels, creating the execution provider, and implementing neural network operations like Batch Normalization, Convolution, and Pooling. This directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient and optimized execution of ONNX models on Arm-based devices within the project.
