in the project contains files that implement the TVM execution provider for compiling and executing ONNX models using the TVM framework. It includes files for custom logging, memory allocation, API implementation, compilation, options processing, execution provider creation, model running, and data transfer operations. The directory also includes a subdirectory for hashing data using different hash algorithms. Overall, the "tvm" directory plays a crucial role in enabling TVM-based execution of ONNX models in the project.
