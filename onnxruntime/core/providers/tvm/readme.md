covers the functionality of running TVM models in the ONNX Runtime. It includes implementations of the TVMRunner class, TVM runner implementations, TVM API functions, data transfer classes, TVM execution provider options, TVM allocator, TVM provider factory, TVM utility functions, TVM execution provider, TVM SO execution provider, custom logging, and TVM compiler. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by including necessary header files, using namespaces, and relying on classes and functions from other parts of the project. It also interacts with the TVM backend through the TVM API, uses TVM-related classes and functions, and accesses ONNX-related classes and functions from the ONNX namespace. Additionally, it interacts with the GraphViewer, IndexedSubGraph, IKernelLookup, FusedNodeAndGraph, and ComputeCapability classes for analyzing and executing ONNX models.
