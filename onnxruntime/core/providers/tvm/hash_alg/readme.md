covers the functionality of hashing data using different hash algorithms, specifically the SHA-256 algorithm. It provides a Hasher class that initializes a HasherImpl object based on the specified hash type and computes the hash value of a given source string. The code interacts with other parts of the system by including necessary header files and using functions from the Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) library for the actual hashing operations. The Hasher class is used by other components of the TVM provider in the ONNX Runtime project for various purposes.
