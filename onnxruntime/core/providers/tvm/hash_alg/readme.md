contains files that implement functionality for hashing data using different hash algorithms. It includes a Hasher class that provides methods for initializing the hasher based on the specified hash type, hashing a source string, and returning the hashed value. Additionally, it includes an implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which provides functions for calculating the hash and digest of input data, as well as converting the digest to a hexadecimal string.
