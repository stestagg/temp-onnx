in the project contains the implementation of various execution providers, each responsible for providing execution capabilities for different hardware platforms and frameworks. These execution providers include CoreML, CUDA, DML, DNNL, JavaScript, CANN, Azure, ACL, ArmNN, ROCm, TVM, OpenVINO, VitisAI, SNPE, QNN, XNNPACK, MIGraphX, NNAPI, CPU, TensorRT, and WebNN. Each execution provider directory includes files and subdirectories that handle specific functionalities and optimizations related to the respective hardware platform or framework. These functionalities include memory management, error handling, data type conversion, graph optimization, operator implementation, and mathematical computations. Overall, the "providers" directory plays a crucial role in enabling the project to execute ONNX models efficiently on a wide range of hardware platforms and frameworks.
