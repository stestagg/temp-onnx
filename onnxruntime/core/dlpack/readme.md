contains code for converting between OrtValues and DLManagedTensors, which are data structures used in the DLPack library. It provides functions for converting OrtValues to DLManagedTensors and vice versa, as well as helper functions for retrieving the DLDataType, OrtDevice, and OrtValueDataType. This code plays a crucial role in enabling interoperability between the project and the DLPack library, allowing for seamless exchange of data structures.
