The directory "ort_flatbuffers_py/fbs" contains Python files that define various classes used in the project. These classes represent different types of objects and provide methods for initializing, accessing, and manipulating their properties. Some of the significant features and areas of functionality include representing argument types, attribute types, dimensions, edges, graphs, inference sessions, kernel type strings, model properties, nodes, operator sets, runtime optimizations, shapes, sparse tensors, tensors, type information, and value information. These classes and their methods are essential for handling and processing data in the project.
