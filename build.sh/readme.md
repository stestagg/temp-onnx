The code in the build.sh file is responsible for building the ONNX Runtime project. It determines the operating system and sets the appropriate directory. It interacts with other parts of the project by calling a Python script (build.py) and passing necessary arguments to it. The code invokes the build.py script using Python 3.6 or higher and passes the build directory and any additional arguments.
