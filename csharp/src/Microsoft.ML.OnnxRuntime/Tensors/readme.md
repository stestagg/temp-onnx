contains files that are responsible for working with arrays and tensors in the project. It includes extension methods for converting arrays into DenseTensor objects, utility functions for array and tensor manipulation, and the implementation of the DenseTensor and Tensor classes. These classes provide functionality for creating, manipulating, and accessing multi-dimensional collections of objects, as well as performing operations such as reshaping and comparing tensors. The files in this directory play a crucial role in handling and processing data in the project.
