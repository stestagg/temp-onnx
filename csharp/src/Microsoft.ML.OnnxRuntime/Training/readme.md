contains files that are responsible for the implementation of training functionality in the project. It includes the CheckpointState class, which manages the state of a training session, allowing users to load and save checkpoint states and retrieve property values. The NativeTrainingMethods class and OrtTrainingApi struct define structures and methods used for training models. The TrainingSession class provides methods for training, evaluation, and optimization of an ONNX model, including the ability to set learning rates, register learning rate schedulers, and export models for inference. It also handles the management of training artifacts such as the training model, evaluation model, optimizer model, and checkpoint state.
