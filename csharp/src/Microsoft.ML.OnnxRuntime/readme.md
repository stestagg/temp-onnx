contains the source code files and subdirectories for the ONNX Runtime for .NET platforms. It includes files for handling the creation and disposal of named output values from a machine learning model, defining error codes and exceptions related to OnnxRuntime, managing tensor data in the InferenceSession.Run() method, projecting managed data to OrtValues for consumption by the native onnxruntime library, verifying the success of native status, defining the API structure for the library, allocating and managing memory, setting up the ONNX Runtime environment, binding inputs and outputs to pre-allocated memory, specifying global thread pool options, representing disposable OrtValues, managing and accessing native memory, holding pre-packed weights of shared initializers, configuring and updating options for execution providers, setting runtime options, holding options for creating an InferenceSession, and registering and applying session configurations. The directory also includes subdirectories for configuring and managing native references for different platforms, working with arrays and tensors, and implementing training functionality. These files and subdirectories play crucial roles in various aspects of the project, such as handling model inputs and outputs, managing resources, interacting with native code, and providing functionality for inference and training.
