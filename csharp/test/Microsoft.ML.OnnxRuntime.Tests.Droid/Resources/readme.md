The "layout" subdirectory defines the layout for Android activities using XML files, with "activity_main.xml" specifically defining the layout using a RelativeLayout. This subdirectory manages the visual appearance and structure of the user interface in the Android application.

The "mipmap-anydpi-v26" subdirectory contains resources related to the adaptive icon for the Android application, including the "ic_launcher_round.xml" file that defines the icon's background and foreground drawables. This subdirectory plays a crucial role in defining the visual representation of the application's icon on Android devices.

The "values" subdirectory contains resource files that define colors, strings, and styles used in the application. These files define the visual appearance and user interface of the application, including primary, primary dark, and accent colors, as well as the app name, action settings, and base application theme.
