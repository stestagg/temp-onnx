contains tests for pre-trained models using the ONNX Runtime. These tests verify the functionality and accuracy of the models by comparing their output with expected results. The tests cover various scenarios, including models with custom operations and models optimized for GPU execution. Additionally, the directory includes tests for model serialization and verification of native methods.
