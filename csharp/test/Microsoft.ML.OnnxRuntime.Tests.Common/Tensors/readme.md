contains files that are responsible for managing tensors and performing various operations on them in the project. It includes tests for constructing tensors from arrays and dimensions, as well as tests for constructing empty tensors. The directory also contains implementations for arithmetic operations on tensors, including boolean arithmetic. Additionally, it provides a class for managing native memory used by the project, allowing safe and efficient allocation, retention, and release of native memory. The directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the correct functionality and manipulation of tensors in the project.
