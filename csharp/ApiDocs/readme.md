contains the project file "ApiDocs.csproj" which defines the configuration and dependencies for a .NET project. It specifies the target framework, enables nullable reference types, allows unsafe blocks, and includes a package reference for docfx.console. The directory also includes the "_exported_templates" subdirectory which contains various JavaScript files responsible for transforming and generating documentation models. These files coordinate the transformation process and generate different sections of the project's documentation website, such as the sidebar, navigation bar, and table of contents. The "styles" subdirectory within "_exported_templates" contains CSS and JavaScript files for defining the visual styles and functionality of the project's web page. Overall, the "ApiDocs" directory plays a crucial role in organizing and generating the documentation for the project.
