covers the functionality of a performance tool for running ONNX models. It provides a command-line interface to load and run ONNX models, measure their execution time, and generate performance reports. The code interacts with other parts of the project by utilizing the Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Tensors namespace for working with ONNX tensors and the CommandLineParser library for parsing command-line arguments. It also includes a generated code file that contains reflection information for the ONNX-ML protocol buffer file, which is used to interact with other parts of the project that require information about the ONNX-ML protocol buffer file. Overall, this code provides a convenient way to benchmark the performance of ONNX models using the ONNX Runtime.
