contains files and subdirectories related to a performance tool for measuring the latency and runtime of running a machine learning model using the OnnxRuntime library. It includes a project file that defines build configurations and dependencies, a generated code file for holding reflection information, and a program file that implements the performance tool. The tool allows users to specify the model file, input file, and iteration count, and provides a report with metrics such as model load time, input load time, warm-up time, total run time, and latency percentiles. It supports loading input data from text files or protobuf files.
