contains the implementation of the InferenceSampleApi class, which is responsible for loading an ONNX model and running inference on it. It also includes a project file that defines the target framework and references another project. The directory provides functionality for creating an inference session, executing the inference, and disposing of resources. It also includes helper methods for loading the model and input tensor data from embedded resources.
