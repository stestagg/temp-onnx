contains files that are specific to the Windows platform in the Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.InferenceSample.Maui project. These files include the main application class definition (App.xaml), the implementation of the application class (App.xaml.cs), an XML manifest file that defines the properties and capabilities of the Windows 10 application (Package.appxmanifest), and an XML manifest file that specifies settings for the Windows application (app.manifest). These files play a crucial role in initializing the application object, providing application-specific behavior, and defining the visual elements and settings of the Windows application.
