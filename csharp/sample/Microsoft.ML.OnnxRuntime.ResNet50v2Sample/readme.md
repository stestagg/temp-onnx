contains files that are part of a software project focused on image recognition using the ResNet50 v2 model. It includes a class called "LabelMap" that stores string labels representing various objects and categories. The project also has a class called "Prediction" that represents the result of a prediction, and a "Program" file that runs inference on an image using the model. The directory also includes project files for configuration and dependencies. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in implementing image recognition functionality within the larger project.
