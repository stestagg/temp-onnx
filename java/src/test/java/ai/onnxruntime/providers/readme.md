contains test cases for different provider options in an AI inference framework. It focuses on testing the functionality of CUDA and TensorRT options, including valid and invalid inputs. The test cases ensure that the providers are available and can be used successfully in a session. Additionally, the directory includes a method to load a specific model into a session and perform inference using the selected provider options.
