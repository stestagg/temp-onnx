contains C code files that provide utility functions and JNI (Java Native Interface) implementations for interacting with the ONNX Runtime API in the project. These files handle tasks such as converting data types, creating Java objects from ONNX values, copying data between Java arrays and ONNX tensors, retrieving keys and values from an ONNX map, working with sparse tensors, creating and manipulating ONNX tensors, managing the environment for running ONNX models, managing threading options, interacting with an ONNX runtime session, setting run options and session options, handling training sessions for machine learning models, loading and saving checkpoint states, and configuring providers such as CUDA and TensorRT. These files play a crucial role in enabling the project to work with ONNX models and perform various operations related to machine learning and inference.
