contains important files and subdirectories that play a crucial role in the project. The "AndroidManifest.xml" file provides essential information about the Android application to the operating system. The "java" subdirectory contains Java source code files that define classes and interfaces for working with ONNX models and executing inference. It includes functionality for handling map and node information, working with tensors and sequences, managing model metadata, and more. The "native" subdirectory contains C code files that provide utility functions and JNI implementations for interacting with the ONNX Runtime API. These files enable the project to work with ONNX models and perform various operations related to machine learning and inference.
