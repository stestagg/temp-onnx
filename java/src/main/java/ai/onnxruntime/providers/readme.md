covers the functionality of configuring and managing different execution providers in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes classes for the CoreML provider, TensorRT provider, NNAPI provider, and CUDA provider. These classes define flags and options specific to each provider and provide methods to set and retrieve configuration options. The code interacts with other parts of the project by extending base classes, implementing interfaces, and using native methods to configure and manage the execution providers. It also interacts with other components of the project, such as the ONNX Runtime API and exception handling classes, to ensure proper functionality and integration.
