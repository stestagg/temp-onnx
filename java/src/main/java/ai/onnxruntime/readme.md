contains Java source code files that define various classes and interfaces for working with ONNX models and executing inference. These files provide functionality for handling map and node information, working with tensors and sequences, managing model metadata, loading the ONNX Runtime library, and handling exceptions. The directory also includes files for memory allocation, logging levels, execution providers, session options, and training sessions. Overall, the "onnxruntime" directory plays a crucial role in providing the necessary functionality for working with ONNX models and executing inference in the project.
