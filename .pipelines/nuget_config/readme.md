The "nuget_config" directory contains subdirectories for different architectures (x64 and x86) and plays a crucial role in managing the dependencies of the project. Each subdirectory contains a "packages.config" file that specifies the required packages and their versions for the project. These packages include Python, Microsoft AI DirectML, and Microsoft Windows CppWinRT. The directory ensures that the necessary packages are available for the project to function properly by managing the installation and configuration of these dependencies.
