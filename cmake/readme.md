contains various CMake files that configure and build different components of the project. These files handle tasks such as setting compiler flags, including dependencies, defining targets, and specifying build options. They cover a wide range of functionalities, including code analysis, compiler flag adjustment, toolchain configuration, nuget package management, build configuration setup, code generation, library compilation and linking, test suite configuration, and Java and Python bindings. The directory also includes files for managing external libraries and dependencies, such as Tensorboard, NumPy, Abseil, DirectML, DNNL, Eigen, SNPE, Mimalloc, Pybind11, Pyxir, TVM, WIL, and XNNPACK. Overall, the "cmake" directory plays a crucial role in configuring and building the project's components and managing external dependencies.
