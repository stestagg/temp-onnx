contains various CMake files that handle the inclusion, configuration, and setup of external libraries and dependencies in the project. These files are responsible for finding and setting variables related to libraries such as NumPy, Abseil, DirectML, DNNL, Eigen, SNPE, Mimalloc, Pybind11, Pyxir, TVM, WIL, and XNNPACK. They fetch and populate the necessary content, set build options, include dependencies, and configure the project to use these libraries. Additionally, there are files that define visualizers for specific types during debugging and generate source code files based on Protocol Buffers. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in managing and integrating external libraries into the project.
