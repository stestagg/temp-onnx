is responsible for managing and configuring various external dependencies for the ONNX Runtime project. It includes CMake files for fetching and configuring libraries such as ipp-crypto, xnnpack, Abseil-Cpp, wil, Eigen, extensions, composable_kernel, onnx_minimal, DNNL, SNPE, Pyxir, mimalloc, NumPy, pybind11, TVM, protobuf_function, onnxruntime_external_deps, cutlass, and DML. These files handle the integration of these external dependencies into the larger ONNX Runtime project by setting variables, configuring build options, including necessary source files, and adding dependencies to target libraries or executables. The code in this directory ensures that the required external dependencies are properly configured and available for use in the ONNX Runtime project.
