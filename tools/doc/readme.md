The directory "tools/doc" contains scripts and files related to generating and managing documentation for the project. It includes a batch file and a shell script that install and execute documentation generation tools, set up the necessary environment variables, and generate HTML documentation. Additionally, there is a Python script that renames folders and updates file references in the documentation directory, ensuring compatibility with Jekyll for publishing markdown documentation. This directory plays a crucial role in maintaining and publishing project documentation.
