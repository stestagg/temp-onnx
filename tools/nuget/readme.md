covers the functionality of generating a list of files to include in a NuGet package for the native components of ONNX Runtime. It takes into account the operating system, CPU architecture, and optional additional providers. The generated file list includes the necessary DLL, LIB, and PDB files for each platform. The code interacts with the directory structure of the uncompressed C API tarball/zip files to locate the required files. Additionally, the code in the "validate_package.py" file is used to validate an ONNX Runtime native NuGet package by checking the presence of required files and libraries for different platforms. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing necessary modules and using functions from those modules to perform the validation.
