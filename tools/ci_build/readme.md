covers various areas of functionality related to the continuous integration (CI) build process of the ONNX Runtime project. It includes code for replacing URLs in dependency files, uploading Python packages to Azure storage, converting CUDA code to HIP code, building Docker images, generating test code coverage, patching Docker images, generating symbol files, reducing operator kernels, compiling Triton kernels, updating build configuration, validating kernel registrations, processing kernel registration files, cleaning Docker image cache, and configuring PoliCheck tool exclusions.

The code in this directory interacts with other functional areas of the system by reading and modifying dependency files, interacting with Azure storage services, converting code for different platforms, building and pushing Docker images, generating test coverage reports, patching Docker images for specific build requirements, generating symbol files for the project, reducing the number of operator kernels used, compiling and converting Triton kernels, updating build configuration files, validating kernel registrations, processing kernel registration files, cleaning Docker image cache, and configuring the PoliCheck tool for static code analysis.
