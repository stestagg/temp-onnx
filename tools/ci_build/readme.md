contains various scripts and files that are used for continuous integration (CI) and build-related tasks in the project. These include scripts for code transformation, building the project, cleaning the docker image cache, compiling Triton kernels, generating test code coverage, generating symbol files, building and pushing Docker images, processing kernel registrations, validating operator kernel registrations, patching manylinux builds, defining exclusions for PoliCheck, reducing operator kernel implementations, replacing URLs in dependencies, updating JSON configuration files, and uploading Python packages to Azure storage. Additionally, the "github" subdirectory contains platform-specific subdirectories that handle tasks related to building, packaging, and testing components of the project on different platforms. Overall, the "ci_build" directory plays a crucial role in automating and managing the CI and build processes of the project.
