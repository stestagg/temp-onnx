is responsible for assembling the files for the Objective-C pod package in the ONNX Runtime project. It interacts with other parts of the project by importing functions and classes from other files, such as `get_pod_config_file` from `c.assemble_c_pod_package` and `PackageVariant` and `load_json_config` from `package_assembly_utils`. The `assemble_objc_pod_package` function takes a staging directory, pod version, framework info file, and package variant as input. It resolves paths, loads configuration files, performs file operations to copy necessary files to the staging directory, and generates a podspec file from a template. The function returns the package name and the path to the generated podspec file.
