The code in this directory is responsible for assembling the files for the C/C++ pod package in a staging directory. It interacts with other parts of the project by copying necessary files, generating a podspec file from a template, and returning the package name and path to the podspec file. The staging directory can then be validated and zipped to create a package for release.
