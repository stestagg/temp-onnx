covers the functionality of generating and validating NPM packages for the ONNX Runtime project. The "pack-npm-packages.ps1" script generates NPM packages for the ONNX Runtime project based on the provided mode, root directory, and target platform. It determines the version number based on the mode and git repository state. If the mode is "dev", it checks the latest @dev version of the onnxruntime-common package on npm.js. The "validate-npm-packages.py" script is used to validate the generated NPM packages. It checks package versions, publish tags, filenames, and release flags to ensure consistency and correctness. These scripts interact with other parts of the project by checking extracted artifact directories and environment variables.
