covers various areas of functionality related to the continuous integration (CI) build process, package creation, testing, and deployment of the ONNX Runtime project on Linux. It includes scripts for creating packages, copying and stripping binary files, setting up Yocto build environments, testing custom ops and shape inference, building Docker images, extracting and bundling GPU packages, testing GPU final jars, building Python packages for ARM64, copying and stripping Java binary files, running builds and tests, building Yocto distributions, building CUDA C API packages, and uploading code coverage data and server binaries.

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by accessing and manipulating source code, binaries, and artifacts, setting environment variables, executing scripts and commands, installing dependencies, configuring build settings, and integrating with external tools and services such as Docker, Yocto, pytest, and code coverage dashboards.
