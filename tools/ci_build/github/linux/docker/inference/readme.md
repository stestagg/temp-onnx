covers the setup of a CentOS 7 environment for building the ONNX Runtime project. It installs dependencies, sets environment variables, and creates a non-root user for building the project.

Interactions with other functional areas:
The code ensures the availability of necessary dependencies for the ONNX Runtime software. It is used in the Zip-Nuget Packaging NoContribOps Pipeline and Zip-Nuget-Java Packaging Pipeline, indicating its role in the packaging and deployment processes of the software.

Directory: ./python
Summary:
The code in this directory covers the building of a manylinux2014 CPU image for the ONNX Runtime project. It sets up the environment variables, installs necessary packages, and copies scripts for building and installing various dependencies.

Interactions with other functional areas:
- It interacts with the manylinux-entrypoint script to execute specific actions during the image build process.
- It copies build scripts from the build_scripts directory, which are used for building and installing dependencies.
- It may interact with other parts of the project through environment variables and installed packages to ensure compatibility and functionality.

Directory: ./aarch64
Summary:
The code in this directory is responsible for setting up a CentOS 7 environment for building the ONNX Runtime project. It installs dependencies and tools, sets environment variables, and creates a non-root user. This code is used in the Zip-Nuget Packaging NoContribOps Pipeline and Zip-Nuget-Java Packaging Pipeline.

Interactions with other functional areas:
- It interacts with the operating system to check the CentOS version and install necessary packages using the yum package manager.
- It interacts with the Python environment to install Python and its dependencies using pip.
- It sets the locale, which may affect how other components of the system handle character encoding and localization.
