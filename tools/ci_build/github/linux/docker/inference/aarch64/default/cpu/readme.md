Summary:
The code in this directory is responsible for setting up a CentOS 7 environment for building the ONNX Runtime project. It installs dependencies and tools, sets environment variables, and creates a non-root user. This code is used in the Zip-Nuget Packaging NoContribOps Pipeline and Zip-Nuget-Java Packaging Pipeline.

Interactions with other functional areas:
- It interacts with the operating system to check the CentOS version and install necessary packages using the yum package manager.
- It interacts with the Python environment to install Python and its dependencies using pip.
- It sets the locale, which may affect how other components of the system handle character encoding and localization.
