covers the functionality of building a custom ONNX Runtime Android package. It includes a Dockerfile to set up the build environment, a build_custom_android_package.py script to build the package using Docker, and a scripts subdirectory that interacts with the build script to create the ONNX Runtime Android Archive (AAR) package. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using the ONNX Runtime repository, specifying build configurations, and copying the resulting AAR package to the output directory.
