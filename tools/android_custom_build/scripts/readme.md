covers the functionality of building the ONNX Runtime (ORT) Android Archive (AAR) package. It interacts with the build_custom_android_package.py script in a Docker container to run the build.sh script. The build.sh script takes in parameters such as build configuration, ops configuration file, build settings file, and output directory. It uses the build_aar_package.py script to build the ORT AAR package with the specified configurations and then copies the AAR package to the output directory.
