covers the functionality related to processing and analyzing ORT format models in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes classes and functions for determining required operators and types, setting up the environment, creating configuration files, and converting between ORT flatbuffers schema values and C++ types. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by using the ORT FlatBuffers Python library, importing classes from the operator_type_usage_processors module, and utilizing modules and functions from other files in the project.
