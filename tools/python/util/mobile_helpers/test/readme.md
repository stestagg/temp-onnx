contains unit tests for two different modules in the project. The first file, "test_check_model_can_use_ort_mobile_pkg.py", tests the compatibility of ONNX models with the pre-built mobile package. It covers supported models, invalid opsets, and unsupported operators and data types. The second file, "test_usability_checker.py", tests the usability checker module. It includes scenarios such as testing models with supported ops, dynamic input shape, and models that break into multiple partitions. The tests verify the logging output to ensure correct information is being logged.
