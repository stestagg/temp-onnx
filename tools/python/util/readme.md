covers various utility functions and scripts used in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes functionality for analyzing ONNX models for mobile suitability, assigning fixed values to symbolic parameters or input shapes, logging, exporting PyTorch models to ONNX format, running subprocesses, parsing configuration files, managing the AzCopy tool, platform detection, optimizing ONNX models, adding OpenVINO libraries on Windows, converting ONNX models to the ONNX Runtime format, file operations, updating ONNX opset, and working with ONNX models. 

The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by importing and using functions and classes from different modules within the project. It utilizes modules and functions from the mobile_helpers, onnx_model_utils, pytorch_export_helpers, ort_format_model, and other related modules. It also interacts with external tools and libraries such as AzCopy, flatbuffers, and the ONNX library.
