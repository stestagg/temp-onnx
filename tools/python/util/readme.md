contains various utility files and subdirectories that play a crucial role in the project. It includes files for importing modules, appending functions, adding OpenVINO libraries to the system PATH, analyzing ONNX models for mobile usability, converting ONNX models to ORT format, working with file paths and retrieving files, managing azcopy tool for Azure Storage, logging messages, fixing ONNX model shapes, optimizing ONNX models using ONNX Runtime, determining the operating system, inferring input information from PyTorch modules, parsing configuration files, running subprocesses, and updating ONNX opset. Additionally, it has subdirectories for managing Android virtual devices and SDK tools, checking ONNX model compatibility with ORT Mobile, and processing and manipulating operator types and models. The directory also includes a script for optimizing QDQ format ONNX models. Overall, the "util" directory provides essential functionality and tools for various aspects of the project.
