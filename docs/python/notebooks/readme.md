covers functionality related to using ONNX Runtime and TVM in Python notebooks. It includes a tutorial for using the TVM execution provider in ONNX Runtime, demonstrating model inference with TVM EP and covering topics such as accuracy check, configuration options, and support for precompiled models. The code also includes a notebook for deploying an image classification neural network using ONNX Runtime on GPU compute SKUs in Azure, using the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) dataset and ONNX format. It covers steps such as obtaining an external ONNX model, registering the model in Azure Machine Learning workspace, building a container image, and deploying the model to the cloud using AKS cluster with GPU. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing necessary packages, including ONNX Runtime, TVM, Azure Machine Learning SDK, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
