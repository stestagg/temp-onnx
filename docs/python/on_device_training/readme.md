covers the functionality of on-device training in ONNX Runtime. It provides an overview of the training process, including the offline phase and the training phase on an edge device. It also includes instructions and examples for generating training artifacts such as the training ONNX model, checkpoint state, optimizer ONNX model, and evaluation ONNX model. The code interacts with other parts of the project by utilizing the `onnxruntime.training.artifacts` module and its functions, as well as the artifact generation python tools and the training API.
