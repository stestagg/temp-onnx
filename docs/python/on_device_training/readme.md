contains documentation and code related to the "On-Device Training" process. It provides an overview of the process and explains how the "onnxruntime-training" library enables efficient training and inference of ONNX models on edge devices. The directory includes a file that provides code for training a model on a device using the onnxruntime training python API, which includes functions for loading checkpoint states, creating modules, optimizing models, and performing training and evaluation loops. Additionally, there is a file that provides instructions and examples for generating training artifacts in an offline step before starting training on edge devices, including the use of custom loss functions and advanced usage examples using the onnxblock library for building complex onnx models.
