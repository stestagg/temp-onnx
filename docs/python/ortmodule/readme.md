contains files related to the ORTModule class in the onnxruntime.training module. It defines the API for the ORTModule class, providing methods and attributes for interacting with the class. The ORTModule class is a high-performance training engine that accelerates the training of PyTorch models. It allows users to replace their PyTorch modules with ORTModule without modifying their training code. Users can execute forward and backward passes using ORT, enabling them to accelerate their training script while still using standard PyTorch debugging techniques for convergence issues.
