covers various examples and scenarios of using ONNX Runtime. It includes code for profiling the execution of a model, loading and predicting with a model, drawing a pipeline of an ONNX model, converting and using models with ONNX Runtime, using the ONNX Runtime backend API, extracting and printing metadata from an ONNX model, and showcasing common errors that can occur when using the onnxruntime library. The code interacts with other parts of the ONNX Runtime project by importing necessary modules and functions, using the onnx package, and utilizing libraries such as scikit-learn, skl2onnx, and onnxruntime.
