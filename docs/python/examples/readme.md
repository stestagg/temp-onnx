in the project contains various Python scripts that demonstrate different functionalities and use cases of the ONNX Runtime library. These scripts cover a range of tasks such as implementing the ONNX Runtime Backend for ONNX, handling common errors, training and converting models to ONNX format, loading and predicting with ONNX models, extracting metadata from ONNX models, drawing and retrieving models in JSON format, profiling model execution, and comparing performance with scikit-learn. These examples showcase the capabilities of the ONNX Runtime library and provide guidance on how to use it effectively in different scenarios.
