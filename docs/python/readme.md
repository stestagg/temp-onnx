in the project contains various files and subdirectories that provide documentation, tutorials, and examples for the ONNX Runtime library. It includes release notes, installation instructions, and API documentation for using ONNX Runtime to load and run inference on ONNX models. The directory also contains examples showcasing the main features of the ONNX Runtime, such as loading and predicting with machine learned models trained with scikit-learn. Additionally, there are subdirectories that provide functionality for accelerating the training of PyTorch models using the ORTModule class, automating the generation of ONNX operators documentation, and deploying facial emotion recognition models on Azure Kubernetes Service. The directory also includes documentation and code for on-device training, enabling efficient training and inference of ONNX models on edge devices.
