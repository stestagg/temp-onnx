contains files that implement concurrency tests for a machine learning model and a ThreadPool class. The concurrency tests involve loading, binding, and evaluating the model concurrently using multiple threads and sessions. The ThreadPool class allows for the creation of a pool of worker threads and manages a queue of work items, assigning them to available threads. It plays a key role in the project's system architecture by enabling efficient utilization of multiple threads for executing tasks concurrently.
