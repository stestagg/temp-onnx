contains code related to the Google Test framework. It includes a file called "main.cpp" that handles command line arguments and stores them as runtime parameters. This allows the program to be configured with different parameters at runtime, providing flexibility and customization. The file also includes a usage function to display error messages for unrecognized arguments and runs all the tests using the RUN_ALL_TESTS macro. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling testing and parameter customization within the project.
