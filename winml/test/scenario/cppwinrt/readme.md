contains code for custom operators and kernels, as well as loading, binding, and evaluating machine learning models using the Windows Machine Learning API. It includes functions for operator fusion, custom kernel registration, and schema definition. The code demonstrates how to create and register custom operators and kernels, and how to use them in a machine learning model. Additionally, it provides scenarios for loading models from files and streams, binding input data to models, and running evaluations synchronously and asynchronously. The code also showcases the use of properties to specify image bounds, pixel formats, and pixel ranges when binding input data to models.
