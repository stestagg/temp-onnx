covers the functionality of logging telemetry events and collecting telemetry data for the WinML (Windows Machine Learning) component of the ONNX Runtime project. It includes the implementation of the TelemetryEvent class for logging events related to model loading, session creation, binding, and evaluation. It also provides a telemetry helper class, WinMLTelemetryHelper, for collecting telemetry data related to the usage and performance of the WinML runtime. The code interacts with other parts of the project by using the TraceLoggingProviderEnabled and WinMLTraceLoggingWrite functions to write telemetry events to the WinML trace logging provider. It also enables trace logging with Microsoft Telemetry for WinML. The telemetry data is used for product and service usage analysis and performance monitoring.
