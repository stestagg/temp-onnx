contains various files that are responsible for handling image-related functionality in the project. These files include implementations of resource stores for converter resources, management of the Direct3D device and resources for GPU acceleration, selection of hardware adapters, loading and storing data from/to disjoint buffers, conversion and manipulation of video frames, synchronization and conversion of textures between D3D11 and D3D12 devices, conversion of pixel values between different nominal ranges, and conversion of tensors to video frames and vice versa. Additionally, the directory includes HLSL shader files for performing image data conversions using thread-based processing. Overall, the "Api.Image" directory plays a crucial role in facilitating efficient handling and manipulation of image data in the project.
