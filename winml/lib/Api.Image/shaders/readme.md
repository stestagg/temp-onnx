contains HLSL shader files that are used for converting image data between different formats in the project. These shaders perform conversions from DirectX textures to NCHW FLOAT and UINT8 Tensors, as well as conversions from NCHW FLOAT Tensors to DirectX textures. The shader functions support various channel orders such as RGB, BGR, and GRAY, and include conversions to formats like BGR8, RGB8, and GRAY8. The shaders utilize thread-based processing to efficiently perform the conversions.
