covers the functionality of configuring and managing the dependencies of the ONNX Runtime Rust Wrapper project. It also generates Rust bindings for the ONNX Runtime library and provides bindings to the ONNX Runtime library in Rust. Additionally, it includes examples that demonstrate how to use the ONNXRuntime C API in Rust.

Interactions with other functional areas:
- The Cargo.toml file interacts with other parts of the project by specifying dependencies and features.
- The build.rs file interacts with the ONNX Runtime library by setting up include and library directories, linking the shared library, and generating Rust bindings using bindgen.
- The src directory interacts with the ONNX Runtime library by providing bindings, defining types and functions, and handling platform-specific differences.
- The examples directory interacts with the ONNX Runtime library through function calls and utilizes various data structures and types defined in the library.
