contains Rust code that demonstrates how to use the ONNX Runtime C API. It provides a sample implementation of loading a model, running inference, and retrieving the output results. The code initializes the environment, creates a session, and prints information about the input and output nodes of the model. It also scores the model using sample data and inspects the output values. Finally, it releases the resources used by the session and environment.
