contains the configuration files for the project, such as Cargo.toml and rustfmt.toml. It also includes two subdirectories, "onnxruntime" and "onnxruntime-sys", which play crucial roles in implementing the core functionality and integrating the ONNX Runtime library into the larger software project. The "onnxruntime" subdirectory handles various functionalities, such as managing the ONNX Runtime environment, providing an API for ML inferencing and training acceleration, and working with ONNX models and sessions. On the other hand, the "onnxruntime-sys" subdirectory provides an unsafe wrapper around Microsoft's ONNX Runtime, including code for building and preparing the library directory, generating bindings, and showcasing how to use the ONNX Runtime C API.
