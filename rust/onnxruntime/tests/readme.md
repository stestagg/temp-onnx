contains integration tests for the ONNX Runtime library. These tests focus on the functionality of image classification models and cover various scenarios such as single-threaded and concurrent sessions, dynamically sized inputs and outputs, and downloading ImageNet class labels if needed. The tests verify the accuracy of predicted classes for sample images, ensuring the reliability and performance of the library's image classification capabilities.
