in the project contains several Rust files that serve as examples and utilities for working with the ONNX Runtime library. These files demonstrate how to load and run inference on ONNX models, display the structure of a model, and validate input and output shapes. They cover various aspects of using the ONNX Runtime library, including setting up the environment, configuring logging, creating sessions, and handling input and output data. These examples provide a practical guide for developers working with ONNX models in the project.
