covers functionality related to handling and manipulating tensors in the ONNX Runtime Rust project. It includes structs and traits for representing and working with tensors, such as `OrtOutputTensor`, `OrtOwnedTensorExtractor`, `WithOutputTensor`, `NdArrayTensor`, and `OrtInputTensor`. The code interacts with other parts of the project by providing a way to handle and process output tensors returned from the ONNX Runtime C library, as well as constructing input tensors for the runtime's session. It uses types and functions from other modules within the project, such as `onnxruntime_sys` and `construct`.
