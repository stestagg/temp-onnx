in the Rust onnxruntime project contains the source code files that implement various functionalities of the project. It includes code for downloading pre-trained models from the ONNX Model Zoo, creating and managing the ONNX Runtime environment, handling errors and error codes, providing a safe API for ML inferencing and training acceleration, managing memory allocation, working with ONNX models and sessions, and handling tensor types and operations. The directory also includes subdirectories for working with tensors and downloading specific models related to natural language and computer vision tasks. Overall, the "src" directory plays a crucial role in implementing the core functionality of the project.
