contains various files that define and provide download functionality for different models related to vision tasks in the project. These models include body, face, and gesture analysis models, domain-based image classification models, image classification models (such as MobileNet, ResNet, VGG, Inception, ShuffleNet, etc.), image manipulation models (for super resolution and fast neural style transfer), and object detection and image segmentation models. Each file provides URLs for downloading the models and includes information about the models' features, sources, and variants. The directory plays a crucial role in managing and providing access to these vision models within the project.
