covers the functionality of downloading and providing various models for vision-related tasks in the ONNX Runtime Rust project. It includes models for body, face, and gesture analysis, domain-based image classification, image classification, image manipulation, and object detection/image segmentation. The code interacts with other parts of the system by implementing traits and conversions to enable the download and usage of these models within the ONNX Runtime Rust framework.
