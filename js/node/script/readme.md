The code in the build.ts file is responsible for building the ONNX Runtime JavaScript project. It handles command line arguments, configures and builds the project using CMake and cmake-js, sets up the build environment, and launches the necessary build processes. It also cleans up the build directories if the rebuild flag is specified. This code interacts with other parts of the project by configuring and building the project, ensuring that the necessary build processes are executed, and cleaning up build directories when needed.
