covers the implementation of the ONNX Runtime backend for JavaScript/Node.js. It provides functionality for creating and managing inference sessions for running ONNX models. The directory contains files that define classes for session handling, backend initialization, and binding with native modules. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing necessary dependencies, interfaces, and types from other modules. It also exports functions and classes for use in other parts of the project, registers the 'cpu' backend, and sets the 'node' version in the environment.
