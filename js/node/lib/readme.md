contains JavaScript files that implement functionality related to handling sessions and running inference using the Onnxruntime library. It includes the implementation of the OnnxruntimeSessionHandler and OnnxruntimeBackend classes, which are responsible for managing sessions and initializing the backend. Additionally, there is a file that defines the binding for a synchronized inference session object, providing methods for loading models, retrieving input and output names, and running inference. The directory also includes an index file that exports common functionality and imports necessary functions and variables from other files. Overall, the "lib" directory plays a crucial role in providing the core functionality for running inference using the Onnxruntime library in the project.
