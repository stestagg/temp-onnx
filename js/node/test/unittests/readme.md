contains unit tests for the machine learning project. It includes tests for the InferenceSession class, which cover scenarios such as session creation, inference running, and testing different options and configurations. Additionally, there are tests for the tensor functionality, which verify various types of tensors, their data, type, and dimensions. The tests also include error cases for invalid inputs. The "lib" directory plays a crucial role in ensuring the correct behavior and functionality of the project's machine learning components.
