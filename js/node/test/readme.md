contains files and subdirectories that are responsible for running various tests for the project. It includes files for unit testing, end-to-end testing, and testing ONNX models. The "test-main.ts" file runs different types of tests and includes a warmup call to optimize performance. The "test-runner.ts" file handles running tests on ONNX models and comparing their outputs. The "test-utils.ts" file provides utility functions and constants for testing and data manipulation. The "unittests" subdirectory contains unit tests for the project's machine learning components, including the InferenceSession class and tensor functionality. The "e2e" subdirectory contains test cases and code for end-to-end testing of the project's InferenceSession functionality using the ONNX Runtime library. Overall, the "test" directory ensures the correctness and functionality of the project's machine learning components through comprehensive testing.
