contains test cases and code for end-to-end testing of the project's InferenceSession functionality. It includes a test case for the InferenceSession.run() function, which verifies the output of multiple iterations against expected results. Additionally, the directory includes code for running end-to-end tests on different types of input data using the ONNX Runtime library. This ensures the correctness and compatibility of the ONNX Runtime library with various data types.
