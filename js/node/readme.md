contains the build configuration, source code, and JavaScript files for the onnxruntime-node project. It sets up the build configuration using CMake, compiles the source files into a shared library, and links the appropriate libraries based on the platform. The "src" subdirectory handles the core functionality of loading and running machine learning models using the ONNX Runtime C++ API. The "lib" subdirectory implements functionality related to handling sessions and running inference using the Onnxruntime library. Overall, the "node" directory plays a crucial role in providing the core functionality for running inference using the Onnxruntime library in the project.
