contains various files that play important roles in the project. These files handle functionalities such as registering and resolving backends for processing tasks, managing the project's environment configuration, defining interfaces and types for handling inference sessions and backends in a machine learning project, converting tensors to different formats, creating tensors from image sources, and performing tensor operations. Additionally, the "index.ts" file serves as a central entry point for accessing the functionality provided by these modules. Overall, this directory is crucial for the project's core functionality related to backends, environment configuration, inference sessions, and tensor manipulation.
