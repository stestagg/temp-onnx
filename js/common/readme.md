The code in the js/common directory covers the functionality related to building the common JavaScript library for the ONNX Runtime project. It includes a webpack configuration file that generates multiple configurations for different build targets and formats. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing shared webpack utilities and using them to add a copyright banner plugin. The generated webpack configurations are used to build the ONNX Runtime common library for different environments and formats. Additionally, the build.js file is responsible for executing build commands, generating package.json files, and launching webpack to bundle the project.
