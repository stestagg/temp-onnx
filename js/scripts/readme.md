The code in the js/scripts directory provides utility functions for downloading and extracting files, prepares test data for the ONNX Node tests, updates version files for different packages, and builds the web version of the ONNX Runtime project. These functionalities are used by other parts of the system, such as modules for handling model files or dependencies, and are integrated with libraries and scripts from other directories.
