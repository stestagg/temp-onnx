in the project contains several files that are responsible for various tasks related to building and preparing the project.

The "build_web.py" file is responsible for building the WebAssembly (WASM) artifacts and copying them to the appropriate directories. It also handles the creation of the NPM package for the project.

The "prepare-onnx-node-tests.ts" file prepares test data for node tests by downloading and extracting files from the ONNX repository. It also removes duplicate test cases by comparing them to previous versions.

The "update-version.ts" script updates the version file "version.ts" in specific folders based on the provided package name. It reads the version data from the package.json file and generates the content for the version file.

The "utils.ts" file contains two functions: "downloadZip" and "extractFile". The "downloadZip" function downloads a zip file from a given URL, handling redirects and checking the response status and content type. The "extractFile" function extracts a file from a zip archive and writes it to a provided WriteStream.

Overall, the "scripts" directory plays a crucial role in automating various tasks related to building, testing, and version management in the project.
