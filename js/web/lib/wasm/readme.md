contains code and files related to the WebAssembly implementation of the project. It includes files for initializing and interacting with a web worker that serves as a proxy for running ONNX inference sessions in a web browser. The directory also contains code for managing the session and running inference using the ONNX Runtime WebAssembly backend. Additionally, it includes common definitions and utility functions for working with tensor data types and logging levels. The directory also contains files for setting session options in a machine learning model and for initializing and managing the WebAssembly module for the project. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling efficient and parallel execution of tasks in the background, enhancing the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.
