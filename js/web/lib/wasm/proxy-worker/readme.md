It interacts with other parts of the project by importing functions from other files to initialize the ONNX Runtime WebAssembly module, create and release sessions, and run inference. The code receives messages with different types and performs corresponding operations based on the message type. It also sends messages back to the main thread to communicate the results or errors of the operations.
