contains files and subdirectories that are crucial for implementing and optimizing GPU-accelerated operations in the project. It includes the implementation of the WebGpuBackend class, which manages the WebGPU backend and handles GPU data, compute shader programs, and kernel execution. The directory also includes files for manipulating and computing with tensors in the WebGPU environment, a logging utility for console logging, and utility classes and functions for matrix operations, shape calculations, and pooling/convolution operations. Additionally, the "webgpu" subdirectory contains optimized files for GPU processing, including shader code for efficient execution of various operations such as binary operations, convolution, matrix multiplication, pooling, and reductions. Overall, this directory enables efficient GPU processing in the project.
