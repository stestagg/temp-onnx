contains files and subdirectories that play a crucial role in implementing and optimizing GPU-accelerated operations for the project. It includes files for managing GPU data, creating and executing shader programs, and defining operator implementations. The "ops" subdirectory contains various files that implement different operations and functionalities for GPU processing, such as binary operations, convolution, matrix multiplication, pooling, and reductions. These files are optimized for GPU computation and include shader code for efficient execution. Overall, the "webgpu" directory is responsible for enabling efficient GPU processing in the project.
