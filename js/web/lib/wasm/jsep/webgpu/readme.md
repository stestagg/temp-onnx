Summary:
The code in this directory covers the functionality related to GPU computation and data processing using the WebGPU backend in the ONNX Runtime JavaScript project. It includes interfaces, types, and functions for representing GPU data, tensor information, program variables, program metadata, program information, and compute context inputs and outputs mapping. The code interacts with other parts of the project, such as tensor operations, shader operations, and compute pipelines, to enable GPU computation and data processing. It also manages GPU data, uploads, copies, creates, gets, releases, and downloads GPU data. Additionally, it provides a way to create attribute objects with cache keys and defines rules for resolving operators in the project. The code in this directory plays a crucial role in managing and executing computations using the WebGPU backend in the ONNX Runtime project.
