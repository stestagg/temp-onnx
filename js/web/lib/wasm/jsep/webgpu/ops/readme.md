contains various files that implement different operations and functionalities for GPU processing in the project. These files include functions for performing element-wise binary operations, concatenating tensors, creating convolution programs, executing matrix multiplication, performing pooling operations, reducing tensors, transposing data, and performing element-wise unary operations. The code in these files is optimized for GPU computation and includes shader code for efficient execution. Additionally, the "ops" directory also includes a subdirectory named "3rd-party" that contains code related to activation functions, convolutional matrix multiplication, and matrix multiplication using packed memory access. Overall, the "ops" directory plays a crucial role in implementing and optimizing GPU-accelerated operations for the project.
