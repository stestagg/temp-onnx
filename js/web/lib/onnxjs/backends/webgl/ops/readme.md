contains the implementation of various operators and operations for a WebGL-based deep learning framework. These operators include BatchNormalization, Binary operations (addition, division, multiplication, subtraction, etc.), Cast, Concatenation (packed and unpacked versions), Convolution (grouped, packed, transpose), DepthToSpace, Dot Product, Flatten, Fusion utilities, Gather, Gemm, Im2Col (packed and unpacked versions), ImageScaler, InstanceNormalization, LRN (Local Response Normalization), Matrix multiplication (packed and unpacked versions), Padding, Pooling (average and max), Reduction operations (sum, mean, max, min, etc.), Reshaping (packed and unpacked versions), Resizing, Shape retrieval, Slicing, Softmax, Splitting, Squeezing, Summing, Tiling, Transposing, Uint8 encoding, Unary operations (absolute value, cosine, exponential, logarithm, etc.), Unpacking, Unsqueezing, and Upsampling. These operators and operations are essential for performing inference efficiently on GPUs using WebGL.
