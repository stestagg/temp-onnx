contains the implementation of various WebGL-related functionalities for a deep learning framework. It includes libraries for manipulating coordinates, encoding and decoding values, handling texlets, and performing vector operations. The directory also contains files for generating GLSL shader source code, managing WebGL contexts, and caching and managing textures. Additionally, it includes files for handling sessions, executing inference programs, resolving operators, and running computations. The "ops" subdirectory within "webgl" contains the implementation of various operators and operations essential for performing efficient inference on GPUs using WebGL.
