covers the functionality related to the WebGL backend in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes GLSL libraries for vector routines, shape utilities, encoding/decoding, and coordinate manipulation. The directory also contains classes for managing the WebGL session, preprocessing GLSL shader code, encoding/decoding texture data, determining texture layouts, and handling WebGL contexts. Additionally, it includes the ProgramManager class for running computations using WebGL programs and the WebGLInferenceHandler class for executing inference programs. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing and using modules, classes, and functions from various files and directories within the project.
