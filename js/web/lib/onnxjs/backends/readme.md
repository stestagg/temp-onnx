covers the functionality related to the WebGL backend in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes the implementation of the WebGLBackend class, which serves as the entry point for all WebGL operations. The code interacts with other parts of the project by creating a WebGLRenderingContext and other main framework components, setting and getting various properties related to WebGL operations, initializing the WebGL backend, creating a session handler for WebGL sessions, and disposing of the WebGL context when needed. It also includes GLSL libraries, classes for managing the WebGL session, preprocessing GLSL shader code, encoding/decoding texture data, determining texture layouts, and handling WebGL contexts. The code imports and uses modules, classes, and functions from various files and directories within the project.
