contains the implementation of the WebGLBackend class, which serves as the entry point for all WebGL operations in the project. It initializes the WebGLRenderingContext and other main framework components, such as Program and Texture Managers. The directory also includes various WebGL-related functionalities for a deep learning framework, such as manipulating coordinates, encoding and decoding values, handling texlets, and performing vector operations. It also contains files for generating GLSL shader source code, managing WebGL contexts, caching and managing textures, handling sessions, executing inference programs, resolving operators, and running computations. The "ops" subdirectory within "webgl" contains the implementation of various operators and operations essential for performing efficient inference on GPUs using WebGL.
