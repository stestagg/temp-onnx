contains code and tests related to the WebGL backend of a machine learning project. It includes test files for various functionalities such as convolution, matrix multiplication, function inlining, packed matmul, pack and unpack operations, and reshape functionality. These tests ensure the accuracy and correctness of the WebGL implementation in the project. The directory also includes utility functions for creating and manipulating arrays and textures in a WebGL context.
