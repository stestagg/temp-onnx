contains Java files that provide functionality for integrating Onnxruntime with React Native. It includes classes for registering extensions, installing Onnxruntime, handling Blob data, and interacting with the JavaScript context. The directory also includes a Java module that provides a React Native binding for the Onnxruntime library, allowing loading and running machine learning models in the ONNX format. The module supports various session and run options for customization and provides methods for loading models, running inference, and disposing of models when they are no longer needed. Additionally, there is a React Native package that includes native modules for interacting with Onnxruntime and a helper module for JSI (JavaScript Interface). The directory also contains a helper class for creating input and output tensors for machine learning models and converting between different tensor data types. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in integrating Onnxruntime with React Native and enabling machine learning capabilities in the project.
