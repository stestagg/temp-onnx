covers the functionality of integrating the ONNX Runtime into a React Native project. It includes files for creating and configuring the React Native package, registering custom ONNX Runtime extensions, installing and interacting with the OnnxruntimeJSI library, and providing a React Native binding API for loading and running ONNX models. The code interacts with other functional areas of the system by accessing the React Native framework, utilizing the BlobModule for handling blob objects, and interacting with the OrtEnvironment and OrtSession classes for creating and manipulating ONNX tensors.
