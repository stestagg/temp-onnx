contains essential files and subdirectories for integrating Onnxruntime with React Native in the project. It includes the necessary build configuration files, such as CMakeLists.txt and build.gradle, which set up the build environment and dependencies for the Android library project. The "src" subdirectory contains crucial code for handling array buffers, registering extensions, installing Onnxruntime, interacting with the JavaScript context, and binding the Onnxruntime library with React Native. It also includes test cases for loading and running machine learning models in the ONNX format, as well as creating input and output tensors for various data types. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in enabling machine learning capabilities in the project.
