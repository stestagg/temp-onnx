is responsible for configuring the Android build settings for the ONNX Runtime React Native project. It sets up dependencies, defines build types, specifies the target SDK version, and configures the external native build using CMake. The code also checks for certain files and enables/disables features based on project configuration. It interacts with other parts of the project by referencing variables and functions defined in other files, such as the CMakeLists.txt file and the package.json file. Additionally, the code in gradle.properties configures the build environment for the React Native Android project, while the code in CMakeLists.txt sets up the build configuration for the OnnxruntimeJSIHelper project, including necessary directories, libraries, and source files.
