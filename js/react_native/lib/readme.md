covers the functionality of implementing the backend for the ONNX Runtime in a React Native environment. It includes the implementation of the 'OnnxruntimeSessionHandler' class for loading and running ONNX models using the ONNX Runtime binding. The code interacts with other parts of the project by importing dependencies from 'onnxruntime-common', 'react-native', and './binding'. It serves as a bridge between the ONNX Runtime binding and the React Native environment, allowing developers to use ONNX models for inference in their React Native applications.
