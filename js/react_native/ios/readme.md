contains files and subdirectories that are crucial for integrating the Onnxruntime library into a React Native project. It includes Objective-C implementation files for a helper class called "OnnxruntimeJSIHelper" that sets up communication between JavaScript and the Onnxruntime library. The directory also contains implementation files for the "OnnxruntimeModule" class, which handles loading and running ONNX models in the React Native application. Additionally, there is a helper class called "TensorHelper" for creating input and output tensors for machine learning models. The "ios" directory also includes configuration files for the Xcode workspace and files related to unit testing and functionality testing of the OnnxruntimeModule. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in integrating the Onnxruntime library and ensuring the proper functioning and accuracy of the machine learning models in the React Native project.
