in the project contains two files that are responsible for project bootstrapping and updating the package.json file. The "bootstrap.js" script checks if the current working directory is the root of the project or if additional arguments were passed, and then forwards the command to the 'yarn' package manager. It performs a bootstrap operation using 'yarn' otherwise. The "prepack.ts" file updates the package.json file by modifying the dependencies based on the environment variables, specifically removing the "onnxruntime-common" dependency for E2E testing mode and adding it with a specific version for other modes.
