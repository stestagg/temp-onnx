contains an XML configuration file that defines the workspace for an Xcode project. It specifies the version of the workspace and includes references to two Xcode project files, "OnnxruntimeModuleExample.xcodeproj" and "Pods.xcodeproj". This directory plays a crucial role in organizing and managing the Xcode project, allowing developers to work on different aspects of the project simultaneously. It provides a centralized location for managing dependencies and integrating external libraries through the "Pods.xcodeproj" file. The workspace configuration file ensures that all the necessary project files are properly linked and enables efficient collaboration among team members.
