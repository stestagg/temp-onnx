covers the functionality of handling MNIST data in the ONNX Runtime project. It includes a file for handling the MNIST data, defining interfaces and a type for data handling. Another file represents the main application screen and is responsible for loading a machine learning model, running inference on an image, and displaying the result. The code in this directory interacts with other parts of the project by providing functions to get the local model path, image path, preprocess image data, and postprocess the result. These functions are used by other files, classes, or components in the project to handle MNIST data.
