contains the source code for the end-to-end testing of a React Native project. It includes files for loading a pre-trained machine learning model and making predictions on images. Additionally, it defines the interface and types for handling MNIST data, providing functions for preprocessing and postprocessing the data. The code in this directory interacts with native modules to perform these operations.
