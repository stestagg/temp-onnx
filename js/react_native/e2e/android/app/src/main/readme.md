contains the Android manifest file, which is responsible for declaring permissions, specifying the main activity, and defining various attributes of the application such as the name, icon, theme, and network security configuration. It also includes the "res" subdirectory, which contains files for defining string resources, application themes, and XML configuration files. The "values" subdirectory within "res" defines string resources for the app name and customizes the base application theme, while the "xml" subdirectory contains configuration files for network security settings. Overall, this directory plays a crucial role in defining the visual and textual aspects of the project's user interface and configuring specific domains for cleartext traffic.
